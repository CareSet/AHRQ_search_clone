<p>A direct comparison of the recommendations presented in the above guidelines for screening for breast cancer in asymptomatic women at average risk is provided below. Recommendations for screening women at increased risk of breast cancer due to a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (e.g., BRCA) or a history of chest radiation at a young age are beyond the scope of this synthesis.</p>
<h3><a name="agreement"></a>Areas of Agreement</h3>
<h4>Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) and Breast Self-Examination (BSE)</h4>
<p>Neither guideline developer recommends routine use of either CBE or BSE. Citing the lack of benefit concurrent with the increase in false-positive rates, ACS does not recommend CBE for breast cancer screening among average-risk, asymptomatic women at any age. Recognizing the time constraints in a typical clinic visit, ACS adds, clinicians should use this time instead for ascertaining family history and counseling women regarding the importance of being alert to breast changes and the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening mammography. The USPSTF did not update its 2009 recommendation statement on CBE, which concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of CBE beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older.</p>
<p>The USPSTF also did not update its 2009 recommendation against teaching BSE, but states that it supports all patients being aware of changes in their bodies and discussing these changes with clinicians. ACS states that even though a substantial proportion of breast cancers are self-detected, the relative contributions of a systematic self-examination versus incidental discovery are unknown. According to ACS, given the absence of evidence of improved outcomes associated with self-examination, the previous (2003) ACS guideline did not include a recommendation for routine performance of or instruction in breast self-examination, and no new studies have been reported in recent years that warranted reconsideration of that conclusion.</p>
<h4>Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)</h4>
<p>Neither developer recommends routine use of DBT. The USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of DBT as a primary screening method for breast cancer. ACS does not make a recommendation, stating that although DBT units are steadily being introduced in mammography facilities, at the time the protocol for the evidence review was developed there were too few data on DBT to include comparisons of 2D versus 3D mammography.</p>
<h3><a name="difference"></a>Areas of Difference</h3>
<h4>Screening Mammography</h4>
<p>Both guideline developers stress the importance of informed, individualized decision-making about screening mammography for women in their 40s, although the specifics vary slightly. The USPSTF recommends that women ages 40 to 49 years who place a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial screening; the ACS states that women ages 40 to 44 years should have the opportunity to begin annual screening. The developers' recommendations vary slightly on when regular screening mammography should begin: the USPSTF at age 50, and ACS at age 45. Recommendations regarding the frequency with which mammography should be performed differ as well. The USPSTF recommends biennial screening until age 74. ACS, in contrast, recommends that women aged 45 to 54 be screened annually, and that women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue annual mammography.</p>
<h4>Cessation of Screening</h4>
<p>ACS does not recommend cessation of screening mammography at a particular age, but rather that women continue as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer. The USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening in women aged 75 years or older.</p>
<h4>Women with Dense Breasts</h4>
<p>The USPSTF guideline addresses a population not considered by ACS&mdash;women with dense breasts. Dense breasts place some women at a higher risk of developing breast cancer and/or a higher risk of having their breast cancer not detected by mammography. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adjunctive screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography, MRI, DBT, or other methods in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.</p>
<p>ACS did not review evidence on the effectiveness of supplemental breast imaging for women with mammographically dense breasts. The developer states that it will consider the evidence for screening effectiveness in women in higher risk groups in a subsequent guideline.</p></div>

            <p>The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 50 to 74 years. (<strong>B recommendation</strong>)</p>
            <p>The decision to start screening mammography in women prior to age 50 years should be an individual one. Women who place a higher value on the potential benefit than the potential harms may choose to begin biennial screening between the ages of 40 and 49 years. (<strong>C recommendation</strong>)</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>For women who are at average risk for breast cancer, most of the benefit of mammography results from biennial screening during ages 50 to 74 years. Of all of the age groups, women aged 60 to 69 years are most likely to avoid breast cancer death through mammography screening. While screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years may reduce the risk for breast cancer death, the number of deaths averted is smaller than that in older women and the number of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies is larger. The balance of benefits and harms is likely to improve as women move from their early to late 40s. </li>
                <li>In addition to false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies, all women undergoing regular screening mammography are at risk for the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to their health, or even apparent, during their lifetime (known as "overdiagnosis"). Beginning mammography screening at a younger age and screening more frequently may increase the risk for overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment. </li>
                <li>Women with a parent, sibling, or child with breast cancer are at higher risk for breast cancer and thus may benefit more than average-risk women from beginning screening in their 40s. </li>

A strong recommendation conveys the consensus that the benefits of adherence to the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. Qualified recommendations indicate there is clear evidence of benefit but less certainty about either the balance of benefits and harms, or about patients' values and preferences, which could lead to different decisions (Table 1 in the original guideline document).</p>

            <p>Both guidelines were developed from systematic reviews of the evidence. The USPSTF guideline is based on evidence reviews prepared by the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC); the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, University of California Davis, Sacramento and the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates EPC. The USPSTF also commissioned a report from the CISNET Breast Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative decision models on optimal starting and stopping ages and intervals for screening mammography, as well as how breast density, breast cancer risk, and comorbidity level affect the balance of benefit and harms of screening mammography. A second decision analysis estimated the number of radiation-induced breast cancer cases and deaths associated with different screening mammography strategies over the course of a woman's lifetime. ACS selected the Duke University Evidence Synthesis Group to conduct an independent systematic evidence review after a response to a request for proposals, and commissioned the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) to update previously published analyses related to the screening interval and outcomes. The ACS Surveillance and Health Services Research Program provided supplementary data on disease burden using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. To collect the evidence, hand-searches of published literature and searches of electronic databases were performed for both guidelines. Relevant details regarding the search including databases searched, keywords used, and date ranges applied are provided. To assess the quality and strength of the evidence, both groups weighted it according to a scheme and provide the scheme. With regard to methods used to analyze the evidence, in addition to performing systematic reviews with evidence tables, both developers reviewed published meta-analyses. The USPSTF also performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. To formulate the recommendations, both ACS and the USPSTF employed expert consensus; the USPSTF also utilized balance sheets. The guideline developers rate the strength of the recommendations according to a scheme and provide the scheme. To validate the guidelines, the groups sought both internal and external peer review; the USPSTF also compared its guideline with those developed by other groups, including the ACS guideline included in this synthesis, and posted the draft research plan, draft evidence reviews, and draft recommendation statement for public comment on its Web site.</p>

Age is the most important risk factor for breast cancer, and the increased benefit observed with age is at least partly due to the increase in risk. Women aged 40 to 49 years who have a first degree relative with breast cancer have a risk for breast cancer similar to that of women aged 50 to 59 years without a family history. Direct evidence about the benefits of screening mammography in women aged 75 years or older is lacking.</p>

            <p>The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for breast cancer with mammography results in harms for women aged 40 to 74 years. The most important harm is the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat to a woman's health, or even apparent, during her lifetime (that is, overdiagnosis and overtreatment). False-positive results are common and lead to unnecessary and sometimes invasive follow-up testing, with the potential for psychological harms (such as anxiety). False-negative results (that is, missed cancer) also occur and may provide false reassurance. Radiation-induced breast cancer and resulting death can also occur, although the number of both of these events is predicted to be low.</p>
