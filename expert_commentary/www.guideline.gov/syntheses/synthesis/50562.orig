<p>A direct comparison of recommendations presented in the above guidelines for screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic adults aged 50 years and older who are not at high risk of colorectal cancer is provided.</p>
<h3 class="SynthesesSubLabel"><a name="agreement"></a>Areas of Agreement</h3>
<h4>Screening in Adults Aged 50 to 74</h4>
<p>CTFPHC and USPSTF both recommend screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 74. The USPSTF makes an "A" recommendation (indicating that there is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial) for screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. CTFPHC also recommends screening in this age group, provided in individual recommendations for adults aged 50 to 59 and 60 to 74. While both CTFPHC recommendations are based on moderate-quality evidence, they have differing strengths. The developer makes a strong recommendation (the CTFPHC is confident that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects) for screening adults aged 60 to 74, and a weak recommendation (the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects but appreciable uncertainty exists) for screening adults aged 50 to 59, because of the lower absolute benefit expected from screening in this younger age group.</p>
<h4>Screening Cessation</h4>
<p>Neither guideline developer recommends routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 75 and older. USPSTF makes a "C" recommendation for screening adults aged 76 to 85 years, stating that the decision should be an individual one that considers the patient's overall health and prior screening history. Individuals in this age group cited by USPSTF as more likely to benefit from screening include: adults who have never been screened; adults who are healthy enough to undergo treatment if necessary; and adults who do not have comorbid conditions that would significantly limit their life expectancy.</p>
<p>Based on low-quality evidence, CTFPHC makes a weak recommendation against (the undesirable effects probably outweigh the desirable effects but appreciable uncertainty exists) screening adults aged 75 and older for colorectal cancer. According to the CTFPHC, the recommendation to stop screening at age 75 is based on reduced life expectancy in older adults as well as the included age groups in the systematic review. The CTFPHC adds, however, that because incidence rises with age and that this recommendation is based on low-quality evidence, adults over 74 years of age who do not have illnesses that affect their quality of life and/or their lifespan may be less concerned with the lack of trials showing benefit or the potential harm. They should discuss screening with their primary care provider to determine their most appropriate screening option based on their personal values and preferences, advises CTFPHC.</p>
<h3 class="SynthesesSubLabel"><a name="difference"></a>Areas of Difference</h3>
<h4>Screening Strategies</h4>
<p>The CTFPHC recommends screening eligible patients with FOBT (either gFOBT or FIT) every two years or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. CTFPHC notes that FIT is more sensitive and specific than both gFOBT and high-sensitivity gFOBT, and is the primary screening test in all but two Canadian provinces. Limited access to flexible sigmoidoscopy, the developer adds, may result in most Canadians being screened appropriately using FIT or gFOBT. However, patients who wish to be screened but prefer less frequent testing, or are averse to stool testing, may be more likely to choose flexible sigmoidoscopy rather than FOBT.</p>
<p>In contrast, USPSTF does not provide any graded recommendations regarding the use of specific screening tests, nor the frequency with which they should be performed. Rather, the Task Force discusses the various screening tests available (stool-based tests [gFOBT, FIT, and FIT-DNA], direct visualization tests [flexible sigmoidoscopy, alone or combined with FIT; colonoscopy; and CT colonography], serology tests [SEPT9 gene DNA testing]), their potential frequency of use, and clinical considerations for each method. The USPSTF found no head-to-head studies demonstrating that any of these screening strategies are more effective than others, although they have varying levels of evidence supporting their effectiveness, as well as different strengths and limitations.</p>
<h4>Screening Intervals</h4>
<p>The USPSTF states that evidence from RCTs demonstrates that annual or biennial screening with gFOBT, as well as 1-time and every 3- to 5-year flexible sigmoidoscopy, reduces colorectal cancer deaths. According to the CTFPHC, although there is no evidence that adherence improves with biennial versus annual screening using gFOBT, biennial screening is less burdensome and is the interval used in most of the RCTs. Additional studies are required to determine whether annual FOBT testing would lead to incremental clinical benefit, adds the developer. The USPSTF refers to Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models, which found that several screening strategies were estimated to yield comparable life-years gained among adults aged 50 to 75 years and an efficient balance of benefits and harms. These screening strategies include (1) annual screening with FIT, (2) screening every 10 years with flexible sigmoidoscopy AND annual screening with FIT, (3) screening every 10 years with colonoscopy, and (4) screening every 5 years with CT colonography.</p>
<h4>Colonoscopy</h4>
<p>The CTFPHC makes a weak recommendation against its use as a primary screening test for colorectal cancer. Although colonoscopy may offer clinical benefits that are similar to or greater than those associated with flexible sigmoidoscopy, direct evidence of its efficacy in comparison with the other screening tests (in particular FIT) is lacking, states the developer. Because of higher human resource requirements and greater potential for harms, the ongoing RCTs would have to show greater efficacy of colonoscopy (in comparison with other tests) before its routine use for screening could be recommended by the CTFPHC. According to the USPSTF, completed trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy provide indirect evidence that colonoscopy&mdash;a similar endoscopic screening method&mdash;reduces colorectal cancer mortality. The developer also cites a prospective cohort study that found an association between patients who self-reported being screened with colonoscopy and a lower colorectal cancer mortality rate. Advantages cited by USPSTF include less frequent screening and same-visit screening and diagnostic follow-up testing.</p>
<h4>Other Screening Tests</h4>
<p>The CTFPHC did not identify any RCT evidence on the mortality benefits of screening with CT colonography, barium enema, digital rectal examination, serologic tests, or fecal DNA testing, and therefore makes no recommendations for their use. The USPSTF guideline discusses three of the newer screening tests not addressed by CTFPHC&mdash;SEPT9 DNA testing, fecal DNA testing and CT colonography.</p>
<p>With regard to serologic testing, although the SEPT9 methylated DNA test was included in the USPSTF systematic evidence review, the single study that met the inclusion criteria found that it has low sensitivity (&lt;50%). It was therefore not included in the table of appropriate screening strategies presented in the USPSTF guideline. USPSTF also addresses stool DNA testing (FIT-DNA), an emerging screening strategy that combines a FIT with testing for altered DNA biomarkers in cells shed into the stool. FIT-DNA has increased single-test sensitivity compared with FIT alone, but lower specificity. According to the USPSTF, there are no empirical data on the appropriate longitudinal follow-up of abnormal findings after a negative diagnostic colonoscopy. Evidence for assessing the effectiveness of CT colonography is limited to studies of its test characteristics, notes USPSTF. It can result in overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and extracolonic findings are common. As with other screening strategies, indirect harms from CT colonography can occur from follow-up colonoscopy for positive findings, notes the Task Force.</p></div>

                <li><strong>Weak recommendations</strong> are those for which the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects (weak recommendation for an intervention) or undesirable effects probably outweigh the desirable effects (weak recommendation against an intervention) but appreciable uncertainty exists. Weak recommendations result when the balance between desirable and undesirable effects is small, the quality of evidence is lower, and there is more variability in the values and preferences of patients. A weak recommendation implies that most people would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. Clinicians must recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual, so they must help each person arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her own values and preferences.

            <p>Both the CTFPHC and USPSTF guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the evidence, prepared by the McMaster Evidence Review and Synthesis Centre (ERSC) and the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) respectively. Relevant details of the literature search (e.g., databases searched, search terms, time period of search) are provided in both reviews. A description of study selection that includes the number of studies identified, the number of studies included, and a summary of inclusion and exclusion criteria is also provided. To assess the quality and strength of the evidence, both groups weighted it according to a rating scheme. Both systematic reviews describe the processes used to analyze the evidence, including the development of evidence tables and performance of original meta-analyses. On the basis of the systematic reviews, CTFPHC and USPSTF formulated the recommendation statements using a consensus process; USPSTF also used balance sheets. The developers also rate the strength of the recommendations according to a scheme. With regard to economic implications of implementing the guideline recommendations, CTFPHC examined the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening as a contextual question using two Canadian modeling studies. USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a service in the formulation of its recommendations. The guideline developers used similar methods to validate their guidelines, including comparison with guidelines from other groups and external peer review. USPSTF also sought internal peer review.</p>

            <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits of Screening and Early Intervention</span></strong></p>
            <p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years reduces colorectal cancer mortality. The USPSTF found no head-to-head studies demonstrating that any of the screening strategies it considered are more effective than others, although the tests have varying levels of evidence supporting their effectiveness, as well as different strengths and limitations (see the table in the original guideline document). About one-third of eligible adults in the United States have never been screened for colorectal cancer, and offering choice in colorectal cancer screening strategies may increase screening uptake. As such, the screening tests are not presented in any preferred or ranked order; rather, the goal is to maximize the total number of persons who are screened because that will have the largest effect on reducing colorectal cancer deaths.</p>
            <p>The benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer declines after age 75 years. Among older adults who have been previously screened for colorectal cancer, there is at best a moderate benefit to continuing screening during the ages of 76 to 85 years. However, adults in this age group who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit than those who have been previously screened.</p>
            <p>The time between detection and treatment of colorectal cancer and realization of a subsequent mortality benefit can be substantial. As such, the benefit of early detection of and intervention for colorectal cancer in adults 86 years and older is at most small.</p>
            <p>To date, no method of screening for colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in any age group.</p>

            <p>The harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years are small. The majority of harms result from the use of colonoscopy, either as the screening test or as follow-up for positive findings detected by other screening tests. The rate of serious adverse events from colorectal cancer screening increases with age. Thus, the harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 years and older are small to moderate.</p>
