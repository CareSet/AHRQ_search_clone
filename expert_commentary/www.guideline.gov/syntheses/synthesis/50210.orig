<p>A direct comparison of recommendations presented in the above guidelines for nonsurgical management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is provided. The AAOS guideline provides recommendations for surgical interventions that are less invasive than knee replacement, which are beyond the scope of this synthesis. The VA/DoD guideline addresses OA of the hip, which is also beyond the scope of this synthesis (recommendations addressing both hip and knee are included). Refer to the individual NGC summaries for recommendations on these topics.</p>
<h3><a name="agreement"></a>Areas of Agreement</h3>
<h4>General Recommendations</h4>
<p>The groups agree that nonsurgical interventions should be attempted before considering surgery in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee, and that the decision to prescribe any intervention should take into consideration factors such as potential benefits and harms, pain severity, functional status, and patient preferences.</p>
<h4>Weight Reduction</h4>
<p>AAOS and VA/DoD agree that overweight or obese patients (defined by a BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [VA/DoD] or &ge;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [AAOS]) with symptomatic OA of the knee should attempt weight loss. Ideally, patients should lose a minimum of five percent body weight and maintain this new level of weight, specifies VA/DoD.</p>
<h4>Complementary and Alternative Medicine</h4>
<p>The developers recommend against the use of chondroitin sulfate and/or glucosamine to treat joint pain or improve function in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee. Acupuncture is also not recommended by the developers for this purpose. Due to insufficient evidence, AAOS and VA/DoD were unable to recommend for or against chiropractic therapy for relief of pain and improved function. VA/DoD was also unable to make a recommendation for the use of dietary supplements.</p>
<h4>Intra-articular Injections (Corticosteroids and Hyaluronic Acid)</h4>
<p>Neither developer recommends routine use of intra-articular corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injection. With regard to corticosteroids, AAOS makes an "Inconclusive" recommendation, signifying a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance of benefits and harms. VA/DoD makes a "C" recommendation for their use, meaning they can be selectively offered/provided based on clinical judgment and patient preferences.</p>
<p>Concerning hyaluronic acid, VA/DoD makes an "I statement," indicating that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against its use. They note, however, that it may be considered for patients who have not responded adequately to nonpharmacologic measures and who have an inadequate response, intolerable adverse events, or contraindications to other pharmacologic therapies. AAOS takes a firmer position, making a "Strong" recommendation against the use of hyaluronic acid in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee.</p>
<h4>Other Interventions</h4>
<p>VA/DoD recommends that the prescription and training of ambulation or walking aids should be carried out by a physical therapist or the referring provider. AAOS was unable to recommend for or against the use of physical agents (including electrotherapeutic modalities) due to inconsistent findings, as well as the use of a valgus directing force brace (medial compartment unloader) for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee due to a lack of available evidence. AAOS also could not recommend the use of lateral wedge insoles for patients with symptomatic medial compartment OA of the knee due to a preponderance of potential harm over benefit.</p>
<h3><a name="difference"></a>Areas of Difference</h3>
<h4>Manual Therapy</h4>
<p>According to VA/DoD, for patients with OA of the knee, the addition of manual physical therapy as an adjunct to traditional physical therapy and supervised exercise can improve pain, function, and walking distance. Although AAOS recommends participation in self-management programs, strengthening, low-impact aerobic exercises, and neuromuscular education, they were unable to recommend for or against manual therapy in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee due to a lack of evidence on the topic.</p>
<h4>Pharmacologic Therapy</h4>
<p>Recommendations for the use of pharmacologic therapies for pain relief in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee differ somewhat. VA/DoD makes recommendations according to severity of OA pain and recommends acetaminophen (no more than four grams daily from all sources) or oral NSAIDs as first-line treatment in patients with no contraindications to pharmacologic therapy. If oral NSAIDs are prescribed in patients at high risk for serious adverse upper GI events, VA/DoD recommends adding a PPI or misoprostol. For patients with <strong>mild to moderate pain</strong>, the developer states that topical capsaicin can be considered as first line therapy or adjunctive therapy. For patients with <strong>persistent moderate or moderately severe pain</strong>, the developer cites duloxetine and tramadol as alternatives or adjuncts to oral NSAIDs. For patients with <strong>persistent severe pain</strong> who have contraindications, inadequate response, or intolerable adverse effects with non-opioid therapies and tramadol, clinicians may consider prescribing non-tramadol opioids.</p>
<p>In contrast, the only pharmacologic therapies recommended by AAOS for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee are NSAIDs (oral or topical) and tramadol. AAOS was unable to recommend for or against the use of acetaminophen, opioids, or pain patches.</p></div>

            <p><strong>Note from the AAOS</strong>: This synthesis of the AAOS clinical practice guideline "Treatment of Osteoarthritis of the Knee" contains a list of the evidence-based treatment recommendations and includes only less invasive alternatives to knee replacement. Discussion of how and why each recommendation was developed and the evidence report are contained in the full guideline from the <a href="/Home/Disclaimer?id=50210&contentType=synthesis&redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aaos.org%2fQuality%2fClinical_Practice_Guidelines%2fClinical_Practice_Guidelines%2f" title="AAOS Web site">AAOS Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif" />. Readers are urged to consult the full guideline for the comprehensive evaluation of the available scientific studies (see the "Availability of the Companion Documents" field in the NGC summary). The recommendations were established using methods of evidence-based medicine that rigorously control for bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility.</p>

Methods used to assess the quality and strength of the evidence were similar in so much as both groups weighted it according to a rating scheme and provide the scheme. VA/DoD also sought expert consensus. To analyze the evidence both AAOS and VA/DoD reviewed published meta-analyses and performed a systematic review of the evidence with evidence tables. AAOS also performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Both of the guideline developers employed expert consensus (AAOS specifies Nominal Group Technique) to formulate the recommendations, and describe the process. The groups rated the strength of the recommendations according to a scheme and provided the scheme. To validate the guidelines, the developers sought internal peer review.

            <p>Individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee often complain of joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty with purposeful movement. The aim of treatment is to provide pain relief and improve the patient's functioning. Most interventions are associated with some potential for adverse outcomes, especially if invasive or operative. Potential harms of treatment include adverse effects of medications and complications of surgical procedures.</p>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Long-term use of oral NSAIDs is limited by adverse effects such as increased cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, ulceration, and bleeding, and renal impairment. The risks of these complications increase with age, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, and probably duration of use. These risks are especially important concerning the typically older population affected by osteoarthritis (OA) who often have comorbidities and take multiple medications. Alternative therapies to reduce these risks are limited. </li>
                <li>All NSAIDs have the potential to increase the risk for cardiovascular (CV) events and therefore should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Naproxen has a neutral or lowest risk for adverse CV events. Use with caution or avoid use of NSAIDs in patients with renal impairment, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, advanced liver diseases, known cardiovascular disease, patients receiving anticoagulants, etc. </li>
                <li>Adverse events associated with topical NSAIDs may be due to components of the formulation rather than the NSAID itself (e.g., unpleasant odor from the dimethyl sulfide metabolite of dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] in diclofenac solution). </li>
                <li>Use of nonselective or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAIDs can result in renal papillary necrosis, acute tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, acute renal failure or other renal-related injury in an estimated one to five percent of patients. All available agents approved for use in the U.S. include a warning for such events in their prescribing information. The risk for renal adverse events is increased in patients who are dependent upon a compensatory increase in the production of renal prostaglandins to maintain renal perfusion. Patients at higher risk for renal injury from NSAIDs or COX-2s include those with preexisting renal disease, volume depletion (e.g., diuretics and vomiting), congestive heart failure, liver dysfunction, cirrhosis with ascites, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and older patients. </li>
                <li>Although acetaminophen is a relatively safe analgesic when taken in usual doses (up to a maximum of four grams daily), the risk for acute liver injury and liver failure is increased in patients taking doses greater than 4,000 mg daily. </li>
                <li>Duloxetine therapy can be limited by adverse gastrointestinal, central nervous system and other reactions. The most common adverse events in clinical trials were nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, somnolence and constipation. When duloxetine is added on to a NSAID, the incidence of adverse events (i.e., nausea, dry mouth, constipation, fatigue, decreased appetite and dizziness) and withdrawals due to intolerance is slightly to moderately increased relative to those for NSAID therapy alone. </li>
                <li>Some patients may develop physical dependence with regular use and experience withdrawal symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal if tramadol therapy is stopped too quickly. Atypical withdrawal symptoms that may be related to the serotonin&ndash;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) effects (e.g., hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, confusion and unusual sensory experiences such as numbness and tingling in the extremities) may also occur. If tramadol is discontinued, the dose should be slowly tapered off to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The main safety concern with tramadol is development of seizures. Tramadol should be avoided or used with caution in patients with a history or risk of seizures or those who are taking drugs that reduce the seizure threshold, such as antidepressants, anorectics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, tricyclic compounds (such as cyclobenzaprine, promethazine), other opioids, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and neuroleptics. Careful attention should be given to recommended dosage adjustments and maximal dosage limits in at-risk populations (e.g., the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment). </li>
                <li>Adverse events such as endocrine dysfunction and sleep-disordered breathing are associated with long-term opioid therapy in chronic pain. </li>
                <li>Results from two studies showed that oral diclofenac has a higher incidence of adverse GI symptoms, whereas topical diclofenac has a higher incidence of local application site reactions, commonly dry skin, rash, and pruritus. </li>
                <li>Adverse events associated with topical capsaicin are limited to temporary burning, stinging and pain at the site of application. </li>
                <li>Local adverse events are the most commonly reported adverse events from steroid injections. These include pain on injection, redness, post injection flare and skin discoloration. The rate of joint infection is considered to be very low when strict aseptic techniques are followed. Systemic effects include rapid suppression of serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP] and cytokines) returning to baseline levels in one to four weeks. In diabetics, a transient, short-term increase in blood glucose levels has been reported. The evidence for an effect on blood pressure is mixed but facial flushing can occur. </li>
