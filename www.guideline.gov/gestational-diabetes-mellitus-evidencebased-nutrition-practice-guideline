<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>: This topic was not included in the EAL systematic review. The recommendations are based on consensus publications.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: MNT 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: MNT</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should provide MNT that includes an individual nutrition prescription and nutrition counseling for all women diagnosed with GDM. Research indicates that MNT provided by an RDN (or international equivalent) as part of a comprehensive nutrition intervention that includes individualization of MNT is effective in improving blood glucose control and neonatal and maternal outcomes in women with GDM. Improved outcomes included lower birth weight and a reduction in the following: incidence of macrosomia (large for gestational age [LGA]), need for insulin therapy, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and maternal hospitalizations, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions and neonatal deaths, premature births and rate of shoulder dystocia, bone fracture and nerve palsy. </p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Imperative </p>
<p><strong>GDM: Frequency and Duration of MNT</strong> </p>
<p>The RDN should provide regular and frequent MNT visits to women with GDM to optimize outcomes. Visits should include an initial 60 to 90 minute MNT visit, followed by a second MNT visit (30 to 45 minutes) within one week, and a third MNT visit (15 to 45 minutes) within two to three weeks. Additional MNT visits should be scheduled every two to three weeks or as needed for the duration of the pregnancy. MNT assists the woman with GDM in meeting her blood glucose and weight gain targets, contribute to a well-balanced food intake and promote fetal and maternal well-being. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Conclusion statement supporting the recommendation <em>GDM: MNT</em> is <strong>Grade II </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Consensus</strong>: The recommendation <em>GDM: Frequency and Duration of MNT</em> is based on consensus publications. This topic was included in the EAL systematic review. However, no evidence was found to answer the research question. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Calories 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Calorie Prescription</strong></p>
<p>For women with GDM, the RDN should individualize the calorie prescription based on a thorough nutrition assessment with guidance from relevant references (Dietary Reference Intakes [DRI], Institute of Medicine [IOM]) and encourage adequate caloric intake to promote fetal/neonatal and maternal health, achieve glycemic goals, and promote appropriate gestational weight gain (GWG). No definitive research suggests there is a specific optimal calorie intake for women with GDM or if calorie needs are different than pregnant women without GDM. Limited research in women with GDM whose pre-pregnancy weights ranged from normal to obese showed no significant differences in most fetal/neonatal and maternal outcomes with various reported calorie intakes. In a study of obese women only, GWG slowed after women with GDM reportedly consumed 30% below their caloric requirements, without adverse effects. </p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong></p>
<p>Conclusion statement supporting <em>GDM: Calorie Prescription</em> is <strong>Grade III</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Macronutrients 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Macronutrient Requirements</strong></p>
<p>In women with GDM, the RDN should provide adequate amounts of macronutrients to support pregnancy, based on nutrition assessment, with guidance from the DRI. The DRI for all pregnant women, including those with GDM, recommends a minimum of 175 g carbohydrate (CHO), a minimum of 71 g protein (or 1.1 g per kg per day protein) and 28 g fiber. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>GDM: Carbohydrate Prescription</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should individualize both the amount and type of CHO for women with GDM based on nutrition assessment, treatment goals, blood glucose response and patient needs. Limited evidence does not confirm an ideal amount (grams or percent of total calories) of CHO for all women with GDM, but suggests an interaction between the amount and type of CHO. Several studies showed positive effects on glycemic control and neonatal/fetal and maternal outcomes in women with GDM, when evaluating varying amounts and types of CHO.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative </p>
<p><strong>GDM: Carbohydrate and Post Prandial Breakfast Glycemia (PPBG)</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should individualize both the amount and type of CHO at breakfast based on nutrition assessment, treatment goals, blood glucose response and patient needs. If the woman with GDM continues to experience elevated PPBG after breakfast, the RDN may further modify the amount or the type of CHO at breakfast to achieve blood glucose targets. Limited evidence examining the impact of CHO on PPBG after breakfast does not confirm an ideal amount (grams or percentage of total calories) or type of CHO for all women with GDM to achieve PPBG targets after breakfast, but suggests an interaction between the two.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The recommendation <em>GDM: Macronutrient Requirements</em> is based on consensus publications. The topic was not included in the EAL systematic review. </li>
    <li>Three conclusion statements supporting the recommendation <em>GDM: Carbohydrate Prescription</em> are <strong>Grade III</strong> </li>
    <li>Conclusion statement supporting the recommendation <em>GDM: Carbohydrate and Post Prandial Breakfast Glycemia</em> is <strong>Grade III</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Vitamins and Minerals 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Dietary Vitamins and Mineral Intake</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should encourage women with GDM to make healthy food choices and consume a variety of foods to meet the micronutrient needs of pregnancy. The micronutrient needs of women with GDM are the same as for pregnant women without diabetes (emphasis on dietary intake of iron, folate, calcium, vitamin D, choline and iodine). The consumption of more food to meet caloric needs and the increased absorption and efficiency of nutrient utilization that occurs in pregnancy are generally adequate to meet the needs for most nutrients, when good food choices are consistently made. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative </p>
<p><strong>GDM: Vitamin and Mineral Supplementation</strong> </p>
<p>The RDN should consider recommending dietary supplementation within the DRI for pregnancy with a prenatal multivitamin/mineral or specific vitamin or mineral supplement(s) to address inadequate dietary vitamin and mineral intake (e.g., iron, folate, calcium, vitamin D, choline and iodine) or documented micronutrient deficiency. Dietary supplements may be indicated in pregnant women at high risk for inadequate micronutrient intake, such as food insecurity; alcohol, tobacco or other substance dependency; anemia; strict vegetarian (vegan) diet; or poor eating habits. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale </strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>: This topic was not included in the EAL systematic review. The recommendations are based on consensus publications. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Meal and Snack Distribution 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Meal and Snack Distribution</strong></p>
<p>In women with GDM, the RDN should distribute the total calories and CHO into smaller meals and multiple snacks per day. The distribution should be individualized, based on blood glucose levels, physical activity and medication, if any (e.g., insulin) and adjusted as needed. Three meals and two or more snacks helps to distribute CHO intake and reduce post-prandial blood glucose fluctuations. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>: This topic was included in the EAL systematic review. However, no evidence was found to answer the research question. The recommendation is based on consensus publications. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: High-Intensity Sweeteners 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Use of High-Intensity Sweeteners</strong></p>
<p>In pregnant women with GDM who choose to consume high-intensity sweeteners, the RDN should educate the woman to select only those approved or generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to limit her intake to the acceptable daily intake (ADI), established by the FDA. The FDA has concluded the safety of six high-intensity sweeteners (saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium [Ace-K], sucralose, neotame and advantame) when consumed within the ADI by the general population, including pregnant women. Steviol glycosides and Luo Han Guo (monk fruit) extracts are also GRAS when consumed within the ADI. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>: This topic was not included in the EAL systematic review. The recommendation is based on consensus publications. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Alcohol 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Alcohol Intake</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should reinforce abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy for women with GDM. The safest choice for all pregnant women is to abstain from alcohol to eliminate the risk for alcohol-related birth defects such as behavioral or neurological defects, growth deficiencies, facial abnormalities and impaired intellectual development. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>: This topic was not included in the EAL systematic review. The recommendation is based on consensus publications. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Physical Activity 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Physical Activity </strong></p>
<p>Unless contraindicated, the RDN should encourage women with GDM to engage in a goal to achieve daily moderate exercise of 30 minutes or more per day. In addition to a healthy diet, exercise can help improve blood glucose control and achieve weight gain recommendations. Both aerobic exercise and non&ndash;weight-bearing exercise (e.g., stretching, swimming, yoga, etc.) have been shown to lower blood glucose levels in women with GDM. Lifestyle therapy for GDM results in lower birth weight and a lower incidence of large-for-gestational-age births and pre-eclampsia. </p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong></p>
<p>The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the GDM Expert workgroup concur with The Endocrine Society's <em>Diabetes and Pregnancy: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline</em> recommendation rating for "Management of Elevated Blood Glucose." </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GDM: Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation 2016</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GDM: Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Following the nutrition intervention of women with GDM, to check progress, the RDN should monitor and evaluate the following components at each visit and compare to desired individual outcomes relevant to the nutrition diagnosis and nutrition intervention. This may include, but is not limited to: </p>
<p><em>Food/Nutrition-Related History Outcomes</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Conditional versus Imperative Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations are categorized in terms of either <em><strong>imperative</strong></em> or <em><strong>conditional </strong></em>statements.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em><strong>Imperative</strong></em> statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their pertinence. Imperative recommendations may include terms such as "should" or "may" and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances. </li>
    <li><em><strong>Conditional</strong></em> statements clearly define a specific situation or population. Conditional recommendations are often presented in an if/then format, such that if CONDITION then ACTION(S) because REASONS(S) </li>
</ul>
<p>Fulfillment of the condition triggers one or more guideline-specified actions.</p>

<p>The following list provides an overview of the steps which the Academy evidence analysis team goes through to identify research through database searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li><strong>Plan the search strategy</strong> to identify the current best evidence relevant to the question. The plan for identification and inclusion of articles and reports should be systematic and reproducible, not haphazard. Write out the original search strategy and document adjustments to the strategy if they occur. Allow for several iterations of searches.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>List inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>. The workgroup will define the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria will be used in defining the search strategy and for filtering the identified research reports. The Academy uses only peer-reviewed research; that is, articles accepted for evidence analysis must be peer-reviewed and published in a juried publication. Additionally, the Academy only uses human subjects in its research and does not include animal studies in its evidence analysis. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify search words</strong>. During the process of considering outcomes, interventions, nutrition diagnoses, and assessments, the workgroup may have identified a number of specific terms or factors that were important, but were not included in the actual question. These terms can be used as additional search terms to help identify relevant pieces of research. Both text word search and keyword search using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) definitions may be used. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify databases to search</strong>. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Agricola, DARE, TRIP, AHRQ and ERIC are some common databases for clinical nutritional research. Note that search terms can vary depending on the database. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conduct the search</strong>. Depending on the number and type of sources found in the initial search, adjustments might have to be made in the search strategy and to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and additional searches run. Changes to the search plan should be recorded for future reference. Document the number of sources identified in each search. </li>
    <li><strong>Review titles and abstracts</strong>. At this point, a filtering procedure is used to determine whether a research article matches the inclusion criteria and is relevant to the workgroup's questions. Typically, the lead analyst, along with a member of the expert workgroup, first reviews the citations and abstracts to filter out reports that are not applicable to the question. If a determination cannot be made based on the citation and abstract, then the full text of the article is obtained for review. </li>
    <li><strong>Gather all remaining articles and reports</strong>. Obtain paper or electronic copies of research articles that remain on the list following the citation and abstract review. If there are less than six citations, it could mean that the search was too specific to identify relevant research or that research has not been done on this topic. A broadened search should be tried. When there is a long list of citations, ascertain whether it includes articles that are tangential to the question or address the question in only a general way. In this case a more focused search strategy may be necessary. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Methods for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Searches of PubMed and hand searches of other relevant literature were performed on the following topics:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) </li>
    <li>Frequency and duration of MNT</li>
    <li>Calorie prescription </li>
    <li>Carbohydrate prescription </li>
    <li>Carbohydrate and post prandial breakfast glycemia </li>
</ul>
<p>Each evidence analysis topic has a link to supporting evidence, where the <strong>Search Plan and Results</strong> can be found. Here, the reader can view when the search plan was performed, inclusion and exclusion criteria, search terms, databases that were searched and the excluded articles.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Formulate the Evidence Analysis Question</strong></p>
<p>Specify a focused question in a defined area of practice. Three key items are used to generate good quality questions: an analytical framework to identify links between factors and outcomes; the PICO (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcome) format to write questions; and the Nutrition Care Process to serve as a framework.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Gather and Classify the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>This step involves developing a search plan to conduct a detailed literature search. The search plan clearly defines the inclusion and exclusion criteria and identifies the key search terms and outcomes necessary to conduct a comprehensive search. The search plan and all literature searches results are documented and assessed for inclusion eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Critically Appraise Each Article (Risk of Bias)</strong></p>
<p>This step involves critically assessing each included article for methodologic quality. Each study is evaluated based on appropriateness of study design and the quality of how the study was conducted by using the Academy's risk of bias tool called the Quality Criteria Checklist (QCC). </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Summarize the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>This step involves achieving two major tasks. First, key data from the included articles is extracted by using the Academy's Web-based data extraction template. Second, summarizing the evidence extracted from each study into a brief, coherent, and easy-to-read summary. The end result of this phase is called the Evidence Summary.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Write and Grade the Conclusion Statement </strong></p>
<p>This step includes developing a concise conclusion statement for the research question and assigning a grade to the conclusion statement. The grade reflects the overall strength and weakness of evidence in forming the conclusion statement. The grading scale used by the Academy is: Grade I (good/strong), II (fair), III (limited/weak), IV (expert opinion only), or V (not assignable) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The expert workgroup, which includes practitioners and researchers with a depth of experience in the specific field of interest, develops the disease-specific guideline. The guideline development involves the following steps.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li><strong>Review the conclusion statements</strong>: The workgroup meets to review the materials resulting from the evidence analysis, which may include conclusion statements, evidence summaries, and evidence worksheets. </li>
    <li><strong>Formulate recommendations for the guideline integrating conclusions from evidence analysis</strong>: The workgroup uses an expert consensus method to formulate recommendations and complete the various sections on the recommendation page. These include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Recommendation(s)</strong>: This is a course of action for the practitioner. The recommendation is written using two brief and separate statements. The first statement is "what" the dietitian should do or not do? The second statement describes the "why" of the recommendation. More than one recommendation may be formulated depending on a particular topic and the supporting conclusion statements.
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><strong>Rating</strong>: The rating for the recommendation is based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The grade of the supporting conclusion statement(s) will be help determining this rating (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). </li>
            <li><strong>Label of conditional or imperative</strong>: Each recommendation will have a label of "conditional" or "imperative." Conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, while imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population without restraints on their pertinence. </li>
            <li><strong>Risks and harms of implementing the recommendations</strong>: Includes any potential risks, anticipated harms or adverse consequences associated with applying the recommendation(s) to the target population. </li>
            <li><strong>Conditions of application</strong>: Includes any organizational barriers or changes that would need to be made within an organization to apply the recommendation in daily practice. Also includes any conditions which may limit the application of the recommendation(s). For instance, application may be limited to only people in an inpatient setting, or not applicable for pregnant women. Facilitators for the application of the guideline may also be listed here. Conditional recommendations will always have conditions specified. Imperative recommendations may have some general conditions for application. </li>
            <li><strong>Potential costs associated with application</strong>: Includes any costs that may be associated with the application of this recommendation such as specialized staff, new equipment or treatments. </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation narrative</strong>: Provides a brief description of the evidence that supports this recommendation. </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation strength rationale</strong>: Provides a brief list of the evidence strength and methodological issues that determined the recommendation strength. </li>
            <li><strong>Minority opinions</strong>: If the expert workgroup cannot reach consensus on the recommendation, the minority opinions may be listed here. </li>
            <li><strong>Supporting evidence</strong>: Provides links to the conclusions statements, evidence summaries and worksheets related to the formulation of this recommendation(s). </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>References not graded in the Academy's evidence analysis process</strong>: Recommendations are based on the summarized evidence from the analysis. Sources that are not analyzed during the evidence analysis process may be used to support and formulate the recommendation or to support information under other categories on the recommendation page, if the workgroup deems necessary. References must be credible resources (e.g., consensus reports, other guidelines, position papers, standards of practice, articles from peer-reviewed journals, nationally recognized documents or websites). If recommendations are based solely on these types of references, they will be rated as "consensus." Occasionally recommendations will include references that were not reviewed during the evidence analysis process but are relevant to the recommendation, risks and harms of implementing the recommendation, conditions of application, or potential costs associated with application. These references will be listed on the recommendation page under "References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process." </li>
    <li><strong>Nutrition Care Process</strong>: The workgroup assigns a category based on the Academy's Nutrition Care Process to display how each recommendation can be used within the treatment process and how they relate to Nutrition Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete the writing of the guideline</strong>: Each disease-specific guideline has a similar format which incorporates the Introduction (includes: Scope of the Guideline, Statement of Intent, Guideline Methods, Implementation, Benefits and Risks/Harms of Implementation), Background Information and any necessary Appendices. The workgroup develops these features. </li>
    <li><strong>Criteria used in guideline development</strong>: The criteria used in determining the format and process for development of Academy's guidelines are based on the following tools and criteria for evidence-based guidelines:

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This guideline is not intended:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For interventions typically within the scope of practice of a certified exercise physiologist or other professional, for which, adequate training in physical activity interventions and other therapies is necessary. </li>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Statement of Intent</strong></span></p>
<p>Evidence-based nutrition practice guidelines are developed to help dietetic practitioners, patients and consumers make shared decisions about health care choices in specific clinical circumstances. If properly developed, communicated and implemented, guidelines can improve care. </p>
<p>While they represent a statement of best practice based on the latest available evidence at the time of publishing, they are not intended to overrule professional judgment. Rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. These nutrition practice guidelines are provided with the express understanding that they do not establish or specify particular standards of care, whether legal, medical or other. </p>
<p><strong>The Role of Patient Preference</strong></p>
<p>This guideline recognizes the role of patient preferences for possible outcomes of care, when the appropriateness of a clinical intervention involves a substantial element of personal choice or values. With regard to types of evidence that are associated with particular outcomes, Shaughnessy and Slawson describe two major classes. Patient-oriented evidence that matters (POEM) deals with outcomes of importance to patients, such as changes in morbidity, mortality or quality of life. Disease-oriented evidence (DOE) deals with surrogate end-points, such as changes in laboratory values or other measures of response. Although the results of DOE sometimes parallel the results of POEM, they do not always correspond. </p>
<p>When possible, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) recommends using POEM-type evidence rather than DOE. When DOE is the only guidance available, the guideline indicates that key clinical recommendations lack the support of outcomes evidence.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The publication of this guideline is an integral part of the plans for disseminating the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics evidence-based recommendations on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) to all dietetics practitioners engaged in, teaching about or researching GDM, as quickly as possible. National implementation workshops at various sites around the country and during the Academy Food Nutrition Conference Expo (FNCE) are planned. Additionally, there are recommended dissemination and adoption strategies for local use of the Academy GDM Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline. </p>
<p>The guideline development team recommended multi-faceted strategies to disseminate the guideline and encourage its implementation. Management support and learning through social influence are likely to be effective in implementing guidelines in dietetic practice. However, additional interventions may be needed to achieve real change in practice routines. </p>
<p>Implementation of the GDM Guideline will be achieved by announcement at professional events, presentations and training. Some strategies include: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>National and local events</strong>: State dietetic association meetings and media coverage will help launch the guideline </li>
    <li><strong>Local feedback adaptation</strong>: Presentation by members of the work group at peer review meetings and opportunities for clinical effectiveness units (CEUs) for courses will be provided </li>
    <li><strong>Education initiatives</strong>: The guideline and supplementary resources will be freely available for use in the education and training of dietetic interns and students in approved Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) programs </li>
    <li><strong>Champions</strong>: Local champions will be identified and expert members of the guideline team will prepare articles for publications. Resources will be provided that include PowerPoint presentations, full guidelines and pre-prepared case studies </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific distribution strategies include: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Publication in full</strong>: The guideline will be available electronically at the <a href="/web/20180712202830/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51052&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.andeal.org" title="Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site">Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712202830im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> and will be announced to all the dietetic practice groups. The Academy Evidence Analysis Library will also provide downloadable supporting information. </li>
