<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to improve social interaction, restricted and repetitive behaviors, play performance, and leisure participation for persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? </li>
    <li>What is the evidence for Ayres Sensory Integration&reg; and sensory-based interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to improve performance in daily life activities and occupations for children with ASD? </li>

    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for persons with ASD that improve parent self-efficacy, family coping and resiliency (including spouse and children), and family participation in daily life and routines? </li>
</ol>
<p>Search terms for the reviews were developed by the methodology consultant to the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) Evidence-Based Practice Project and AOTA staff, in consultation with the review authors of each question, and by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to ensure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table F.1 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to the population (individuals with autism spectrum disorder [ASD]) and types of interventions included in each systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and refined the search strategies. Databases and sites searched included Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and OTseeker. In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were included in the search. These databases are peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct systematic reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Moreover, reference lists from articles included in the systematic reviews were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included.</p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature that is incorporated into a review. The review of all four questions was limited to peer-reviewed scientific literature published in English. The intervention approaches examined were within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The literature included in the review was published between 2006 and April 2013 and included study participants with ASD. (The earlier review included studies published between 1986 and 2006.) The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non&ndash;peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. Studies included in the review are Level I&ndash;III evidence. Level IV and V evidence was included only when higher level evidence on a given topic was not found.</p>
<p>A total of 18,120 citations and abstracts were included in the reviews. For Question 1, there were 10,129 references; for Question 2,885 references; for Question 3, 2,649 references; and for Question 4, 4,457 references. The consultant to the Evidence-Based Practice Project completed the first step of eliminating references based on citation and abstract. The systematic reviews were carried out as academic partnerships, in which academic faculty worked with graduate students to conduct the reviews. Review teams completed the next step of eliminating references based on citations and abstracts. The full-text versions of potential articles were retrieved, and the review teams determined final inclusion in the review based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>A major focus of the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA)'s Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) projects is an ongoing program of systematic review of multidisciplinary scientific literature, using focused questions and standardized procedures to identify occupational therapy&ndash;relevant evidence and discuss its implications for practice, education, and research. An evidence-based perspective is founded on the assumption that scientific evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention can be judged to be more or less strong and valid according to a hierarchy of research designs, an assessment of the quality of the research, or both.</p>
<p>AOTA uses standards of evidence modeled on those developed in evidence-based medicine. This model standardizes and ranks the value of scientific evidence for biomedical practice using a grading system presented in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field. In this system, the highest level of evidence, <em>Level I</em>, includes systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group, and the outcomes of both groups are compared. Other levels of evidence include <em>Level II</em> studies, in which assignment to a treatment or a control group is not randomized (cohort study); <em>Level III</em> studies, which do not have a control group; <em>Level IV</em> studies, which use a single-case experimental design, sometimes reported over several participants; and <em>Level V</em> studies, which are case reports and expert opinion that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements.</p>
<p>The systematic reviews on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were supported by AOTA as part of the EBP Project. AOTA is committed to supporting the role of occupational therapy in this important area of practice. The previous review covered the time frame of 1986&ndash;2006. The current systematic reviews were updated for the period from 2006 to April 2013, because occupational therapy practitioners need access to the results of the latest and best available literature to support intervention within the scope of occupational therapy practice.</p>
<p>Four focused questions, based on the search strategy of the earlier review, were developed for the updated review. Additional search terms were added to ensure maximum coverage of the four questions. These questions were reviewed by review authors, an advisory group of experts in the field, AOTA staff, and the consultant to the AOTA EBP Project.</p></div></p>

Before implementing any new intervention with a client, it is always prudent for the occupational therapy practitioner to be aware of the potential benefits and harms of the intervention. Clinical reasoning based on a sound evaluation of the client's strengths and limitations and an understanding of the intervention should be exercised to determine the potential benefits and harms of an intervention for an individual client.</p></div></p>
