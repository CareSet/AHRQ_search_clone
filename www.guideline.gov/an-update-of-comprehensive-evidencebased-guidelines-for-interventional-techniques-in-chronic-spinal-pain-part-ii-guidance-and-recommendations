</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implantables</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The evidence for SCS is fair in managing patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBBS). </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Implantable Intrathecal Drug Administration Systems</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    <li>The recommendations for intrathecal infusion pumps include recalcitrant chronic noncancer pain. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antithrombotic and Antiplatelet Therapy</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) including low dose aspirin do not increase the risk of spinal epidural hematoma and are not a contraindication for interventional techniques. </li>
    <li>However, high dose aspirin and combination of multiple drugs should be taken into consideration and may or may not be discontinued based on clinical judgment of individual risk and benefits assessment. In this regard, the simultaneous use of multiple agents that possess anticoagulant properties (e.g., NSAIDs or aspirin along with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs], fish oil, etc.) will increase the risk of morbidity and/or mortality. </li>
    <li>Phosphodiesterase inhibitors including dipyridamole (Persantine), Aggrenox (dipyridamole plus aspirin), and cilostazol (Pletal) do not appear to increase the risk of spinal epidural hematoma and are not a contraindication for interventional techniques (evidence &ndash; fair). They may or may not be discontinued prior to interventional techniques (evidence &ndash; good). </li>
    <li>Platelet aggregation inhibitors including ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plavix), and prasugrel (Effient) may be continued or discontinued prior to interventional techniques (evidence &ndash; fair). </li>
    <li>Based on patient factors and managing cardiologist's opinion, if a decision is made to discontinue, the current recommendations are that they may be discontinued for 7 days with clopidogrel and prasugrel and/or 10 to 15 days with ticlopidine (evidence &ndash; fair). </li>
    <li>There is also emerging evidence that discontinuation of 3 days may be effective (evidence &ndash; limited). </li>
    <li>If a clinician chooses to discontinue, they may be discontinued for 7 days (evidence &ndash; limited). </li>
    <li>Warfarin may be continued or discontinued based on international normalized ratio (INR) achieved during therapy (evidence &ndash; good). </li>
    <li>For high risk interventional techniques including interlaminar epidural injections, percutaneous adhesiolysis, disc decompression, sympathetic blocks, and placement of implantables, warfarin must be discontinued for an appropriate period of time and INR of 1.4 or less must be achieved (evidence &ndash; good). </li>
    <li>For intermediate risk procedures such as caudal epidural injection, paravertebral interventional techniques, and peripheral joint injections, warfarin must be continued for an appropriate period of time and an INR of 2 or less may be considered (evidence &ndash; limited). </li>
    <li>Unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) may be discontinued approximately 12 hours prior to providing interventional techniques (evidence - limited). </li>
    <li>Dabigatran (Pradaxa) may be stopped 2 to 4 days for major interventional techniques with high risk of bleeding in patients with creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL per minute. For low risk or paravertebral interventional techniques and caudal, it may be stopped for one day in patients with normal renal function. May be stopped at least 4 to 5 days for those with creatinine less than 50 mL per minute (evidence &ndash; limited). </li>
    <li>Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) may be stopped for one day or longer (evidence &ndash; limited). </li>

<p>The search period included articles from 1966 through 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The search strategy emphasized treating chronic spinal, non-cancer pain of various origins and spinal interventions. At least 2 of the review authors independently, in an unblinded standardized manner, performed each search. All searches were combined to obtain a unified search strategy. Any disagreements between reviewers were resolved by a third author and consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Considering Studies</strong></p>
<p><em>Types of Studies</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) </li>
    <li>Nonrandomized observational studies </li>
    <li>Diagnostic accuracy studies </li>
    <li>Case reports and reviews for adverse effects </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Types of Patients</em></p>
<p>Patients of interest were adults aged at least 18 years with chronic spinal pain of at least 3 months duration. Patients must have failed previous pharmacotherapy, exercise therapy, etc., prior to starting interventional pain management techniques.</p>
<p><em>Types of Interventions</em></p>
<p>Diagnostic and therapeutic spinal interventions appropriately performed with proper technique under image guidance (fluoroscopy, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) were included. Ultrasound-guided interventions or interventions without fluoroscopic or CT guidance were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The reviews focused on randomized trials, observational studies, diagnostic accuracy studies, and reports of complications. The population of interest was patients suffering from chronic pain of spinal origin. Only epidural interventions, facet joint interventions, sacroiliac joint interventions, discography, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, percutaneous disc decompression, spinal cord stimulation, and implantable infusion systems were included. Reports without appropriate diagnosis, nonsystematic reviews, book chapters, and case reports were excluded.</p>
<p><em>Selection of Studies</em></p>
<p>In an unblinded, standardized manner, 2 review authors screened the abstracts of all identified studies against the inclusion criteria. All articles with possible relevance were then retrieved in full text for a comprehensive assessment of internal validity, quality, and adherence to inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</em></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Evidence assessment for systematic reviews was based on methodological quality assessment criteria recommended for randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic studies. The methodology utilized in the systematic reviews followed the review process derived from evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies; Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for the conduct of randomized trials; Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE); Cochrane guidelines; Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) studies; Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS); Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL); and Chou and Huffman&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Relevance</strong></p>
<p>The clinical relevance of the included studies was evaluated according to 5 questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Each question was scored as positive (+) if the clinical relevance item was met, negative (&ndash;) if the item was not met, and unclear (?) if data were not available to answer the question. (See Table 2 in Part I of the guidelines for a list of clinical relevance questions [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field].)</p>
<p><strong>Study Design Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered to provide the most internally valid evidence for medical decision-making. In the specialty of interventional pain management, results from clinical trials, both randomized and observational, with substantial impact on patient care, have been ruled ineffective based on flawed methodology of evidence synthesis. In one famous meta-analysis, authors proved that the evidence from randomized trials may be inaccurate. These authors attempted a meta-analysis, reviewing the available randomized trials supporting the use of parachutes to prevent injuries caused by jumping out of an airplane. There were no trials available which had been done, and they concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the use of parachutes. Realizing that very few interventions in medicine work quite as definitively as parachutes, this attempted meta-analysis reminds us that some interventions are of such intuitive value that they do not require RCTs.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a clinical trial as "any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes." Very few studies in interventional pain management are RCTs and treatments even in surgery are only half as likely to be based on RCTs as treatments in internal medicine. There are multiple studies and opinions for and against randomized trials and observational studies and their importance.</p>
<p>Refer to Part I of the original guideline document for additional discussion of study design assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Methodological Quality or Validity Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The methodological quality assessment was performed by 2 review authors who independently assessed, in an unblinded standardized manner, the internal validity of all the studies. The methodological quality assessment was performed in such a manner as to avoid any discrepancies, which when identified were evaluated by a third reviewer and settled by consensus. Authors with a perceived conflict of interest for any manuscript were recused from reviewing the manuscript.</p>
<p>For adverse effects, confounding factors, etc., it was not possible to use quality assessment criteria. Thus, these were considered based on the interpretation of the reports published and critical analysis of the literature.</p>
<p>The quality of each individual article used in this analysis was assessed using Cochrane review criteria for randomized trials (see Table 4 in Part I of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies (see Tables 5 and 6 in Part I in the original guideline document), and the QAREL checklist for diagnostic accuracy studies (see Table 7 in Part I in the original guideline document). For nonrandomized observational studies, the patient population was required to have at least 50 total or at least 25 in each group if there were comparison groups. Even though none of these instruments or criteria has been systematically assessed, the advantages and disadvantages of each system were debated.</p>
<p>Each study was evaluated by at least 2 authors for stated criteria and any disagreements discussed with a third reviewer.</p>
<p>The QAREL checklist has been validated and also utilized in multiple systematic reviews. Each study in the final sample of eligible manuscripts was assessed using a 12-item appraisal checklist designed to assess the quality and applicability of studies. The face validity of these checklists was established by consultation with methodology experts and comparison with quality appraisal checklists used in other systematic reviews examining diagnostic reliability. This checklist was also developed in accordance with the STARD and the QUADAS appraisal tool. Studies were not given an overall numeric quality score; instead, each item was considered separately and graded as "yes," "no," "unclear," or "not applicable."</p>
<p>All studies were required to meet a minimum of 50% of applicable criteria. Studies scoring less were also described and provided with an opinion and a critical analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement of Treatment Effect in Data Synthesis (Meta-Analysis)</strong></p>
<p>Data were summarized using meta-analysis when at least 5 studies per type of disorder were available meeting the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Conclusions of both qualitative and quantitative outcome measures were evaluated. Qualitative (the direction of a treatment effect) and quantitative (the magnitude of a treatment effect) conclusions were evaluated. Random-effects meta-analysis to pool data was also used.</p>
<p>The minimum amount of change in pain score to be clinically meaningful has been described as a 2-point change on a scale of 0 to 10 (or 20 percentage points), based on findings in trials studying general chronic pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic low back pain. However, recent studies evaluating interventional techniques have used &gt;50% pain relief as the cutoff threshold for clinically meaningful improvement in pain relief or functional status. Consequently, for analysis in these systematic reviews, the guideline developers utilized clinically meaningful pain relief of at least a 3-point change on an 11-point scale of 0 to 10, or 50% pain relief from the baseline, and/or a functional status improvement of 40% or more as clinically significant.</p>
<p>Outcomes may be assessed between the groups or in the same group from baseline to post treatment, however, some methodologists tend to focus only on between the groups. This essentially provides lack of improvement or lack of difference between the groups in an active control trial, non-inferiority, or equivalence trial. Thus, it is essential that outcomes be monitored pretreatment and posttreatment rather than between the groups or utilizing both methodologies. Consequently, in all the systematic reviews and the evidence assessment for interventional pain management, the outcomes have been assessed based on the design between the groups and in the same group pre and post treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome of the Studies</strong></p>
<p>Randomized trials were judged to be positive if the intervention was clinically relevant and effective, either with a placebo control or an active control. This indicates that the difference in effect for the primary outcome measure is statistically significant on the conventional 5% level. In a negative study, no significant difference between the treatment groups or no improvement from baseline is identified.</p>
<p>Observational studies were judged to be positive if the intervention was effective, with outcomes reported at one month, 3 months, 6 months, and one year. The outcomes were judged as improvement in at least 40% of patients at distinct reference points with positive or negative results reported at one month, 3 months, 6 months, and one year.</p>
<p>Outcomes included the prevalence of pain and false-positive rate. Based on the above parameters, the reliability of the data derived from each study was assessed.</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of various methodologies available are too extensive to be described in this manuscript. These have been described in various other manuscripts in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Evidence analysis was performed based on United States Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) criteria (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field), which has been utilized by multiple authors. The analysis was conducted using 3 levels of evidence ranging from good, fair, and limited or poor.</p></div></p>

<p>The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) convened a multidisciplinary panel of 51 experts in various fields to review the evidence and formulate recommendations for interventional techniques in managing chronic spinal pain. The panel was instructed to answer questions and develop evidence pertaining to important aspects of spinal interventional techniques. Members of the panel were also requested to develop comprehensive systematic reviews on various related subjects in preparation for the development of spinal interventional techniques guidelines. Other independent systematic reviews were also considered. The panel convened in person on 3 occasions at ASIPP workshops in Memphis, TN, and also had 6 webinars and/or telephone conferences. The majority of participants attended multiple meetings.</p>
<p>The committee provided a broad representation of academic and non-academic clinical practitioners, reflecting a variety of practices and geographic areas, all with interest and expertise in interventional techniques and chronic pain management. The committee formulized the elements of the guideline preparation process, including literature searches, literature synthesis, consensus evaluation, open forum presentations, and formal endorsement by the ASIPP Board of Directors and peer review. However, there were no patients and patient advocates or patient/consumer organizations included in the guideline development process, which may be considered as a deficiency.</p>
<p>The evidence synthesis and analysis resulted in multiple conclusions and recommendations based on evidence with overwhelming majority consent.</p>
<p>Recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which essentially incorporate all other guidance for guideline development, were applied in the preparation of ASIPP guidelines. All of the guidelines share a similar philosophy, thus, this guideline development process uses the IOM's 8 proposed standards (see the original guideline for more information; see also Part I in the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p><strong>Grading Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>As recommended by the IOM, for each recommendation, information was provided with an explanation of the reasoning underlying the recommendation, including a clear description of potential benefits and harms; a summary of relevant available evidence; description of the quality, quantity, and consistency of the aggregate available evidence; an explanation of the part played by values, opinion, theory, and clinical experience in deriving the recommendations; a rating of the level of confidence; a rating of the strength of recommendation; and a description and explanation of any differences of opinion regarding the recommendation. In grading recommendations, the grading of recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) was utilized (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div></p>

    <li>The authors are solely responsible for the content of this article. No statement on this article should be construed as an official position of American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP). The guidelines do not represent "standard of care." </li>
    <li>While these guidelines may be applied by any specialty, they are specifically intended for use by interventional pain physicians. These guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. It is expected that a provider will establish a plan of care on a case-by-case basis, taking into account an individual patient's medical condition, personal needs, and preferences, and the physician's experience. Based on an individual patient's needs, treatment different from that outlined here could be warranted. Consequently, these guidelines do not represent a "standard of care." </li>
    <li>The goal of these guidelines is to provide practitioners and payers with information to determine whether the available evidence supports the notion of a "standard" for interventional techniques. "Standard" refers to what is applicable to the majority of patients, with a preference for patient convenience and ease of administration without compromising treatment efficacy or morbidity. It is essential to recognize the difference between "standard" and "standard of care," as utilized as a legal definition. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Management of Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
<p>Conflicts were managed by limiting involvement of the individuals with conflicts of interest and re-evaluating the evidence provided by those with conflicts of interest, even though there was no direct funding received for this project. Consequently, the guideline developers have also undertaken extensive efforts to avoid direct, as well as indirect, internal and external conflicts of interest. Prior to selection of the guideline development group, all the individuals considered for membership declared all interests and activities potentially resulting in conflicts of interest with development group activity, by written disclosure. Disclosures reflected all current and planned commercial services, including services from which a clinician derives a substantial portion of income, noncommercial, intellectual, institutional, and patient/public activities pertinent to the potential scope of the clinical practice guidelines. There were no significant conflicts of interest among the members, thus, there was no necessity for divestment or exclusion. Even then, care was exercised to avoid any conflicts not disclosed by the usual disclosure procedure in decision-making.</p>
<p>Sixteen of the 51 authors provided information that they received funding from industry; however, of these, less than 5% were receiving funding from drug makers, only 2% were receiving from industry, and 2% were receiving funding for research or engaged in speaking from industry. Editorially, appropriate measures were taken to avoid any conflicting opinions from authors receiving funding from the industry.</p>
