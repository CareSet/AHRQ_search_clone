<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 1a. Diagnosis of Posterior Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45&deg; to 1 side and neck extended 20&deg; with the affected ear down. The maneuver should be repeated with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative.</p>

    <li>Benefits: Symptom resolution in 15% to 85% at 1 month without intervention </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Prolonged symptoms compared with other interventions that may expose patients to increased risks for falls or lost days of work; indirect costs of delayed resolution compared with other measures </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Relative balance of benefits and harms </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The panel felt strongly in favor of treatment with CRP rather than observation, particularly with respect to the value of an expedited time to symptom resolution. The panel felt that observation may not be suitable for older patients, patients with preexisting balance disorders, or individuals at high risks for falls </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Definition of follow-up is not explicitly specified </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Large </li>

The total final data set retained 27 RCTs that met inclusion criteria. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>In developing this update of the evidence-based clinical practice guideline, the methods outlined in the third edition of the American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guideline development manual were followed explicitly (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>An executive summary of the original benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline was sent to a panel of expert reviewers from the fields of general otolaryngology, otology, neurotology, neurology, family practice, nursing, physical therapy, emergency medicine, radiology, audiology, and complementary medicine who assessed the key action statements to decide if they should be kept in their current form, revised, or removed and to identify new research that might affect the guideline recommendations. The reviewers concluded that the original guideline action statements remained valid but should be updated with minor modifications. Suggestions were also made for new key action statements.</p>
<p>The AAO-HNSF assembled a guideline update group representing the disciplines of otolaryngology&ndash;head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, physical therapy, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. The guideline update group had several conference calls and 1 in-person meeting, during which it defined the scope and objectives of updating the guideline, reviewed comments from the expert panel review for each key action statement, identified other quality improvement opportunities, and reviewed the literature search results.</p>
<p>The evidence profile for each statement in the earlier guideline was then converted into an expanded action statement profile for consistency with the current development standards. Information was added to the action statement profiles regarding the quality improvement opportunity to which the action statement pertained, the guideline panel's level of confidence in the published evidence, differences of opinion among panel members, intentional vagueness, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. New key action statements were developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. Electronic decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) was used to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles.</p>
<p>The updated guideline then underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. The guideline update group received summary appraisals and modified an advanced draft of the guideline based on the appraisal.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Paroxysmal positional nystagmus induced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver carries the risk of provoking temporary symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). </li>
    <li>With respect to complications of treatment, the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) is associated with mild and generally self-limiting adverse effects in about 12% of those treated. Some patients may experience an immediate falling sensation within 30 minutes after the maneuver and may benefit from counseling prior to the maneuver. Serious complications from the CRP have not been identified in multiple randomized controlled trials. The most commonly encountered complications include nausea, vomiting, fainting, and conversion to lateral canal BPPV during the course of treatment (so-called canal switch or conversion). Canal conversion occurs in about 6% to 7% of those treated with CRP, underscoring the importance of recognizing the lateral canal variant of BPPV and the need for more unique and different CRPs. Another potential side effect after the CRP is postural instability that can last 24 hours with a tendency to fall backward or forward. </li>
    <li>Patients who elect observation should be informed about the possibility of longer duration of symptoms when compared with patients receiving active treatment maneuvers. There is also a potential for higher recurrence rates of another episode of BPPV with the observation option. </li>

    <li>Some patients were unable to tolerate the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) because of cervical spine problems, while others complained of headache or pain in the neck after treatments. Patients with any of the relative contraindications, including cervical spondylosis, known cervical disk disease, and/or unstable cardiac conditions, may be candidates for observation rather than active treatment. </li>
    <li>Anecdotally, several investigators have suggested that the CRP should be applied cautiously in patients with cervical spine disease, certain vascular conditions, retinal detachment, and other contraindications to its performance. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible provider, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline update group sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The complete guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em>, which will facilitate reference and distribution. An executive summary will be published highlighting key recommendations from the guideline to facilitate information dissemination. Portions of the guideline will be presented at various clinical meetings, including planned presentation in a mini-seminar at the annual meeting of the Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Existing brochures and publications by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline recommendations. A visual depiction of the anticipated diagnostic and therapeutic treatment algorithm that arises from the current guideline's recommendations is presented in Figure 8 in the original guideline document. This treatment algorithm emphasizes the diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs). Members of the panel will be representing the guideline at their specialty societies for possible presentation and endorsement.</p>
<p>Because the guideline presents recommendations for an office-based diagnosis of BPPV based on positional maneuvers, an anticipated barrier to implementation is clinician unfamiliarity with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and with the supine roll test. In addition to the descriptive and diagrammatic representations of the diagnostic tests provided in the guideline, a video is available at <a href="/web/20180614224158/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51020&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fyoutu.be%2fKLt2LtISPmQ" title="YouTube Web site">https://youtu.be/KLt2LtISPmQ</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180614224158im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>, illustrating performance of these maneuvers as well as representations of the expected diagnostic nystagmus findings, especially in the case of lateral canal BPPV. It will be important to incorporate guideline recommendations into the development of point-of-care decision support tools to encourage point-of-service adherence to the guidelines and to facilitate rapid clinical decision making in a busy office environment.</p>
<p>Another barrier to implementation of this guideline is potential clinician or patient preference for the ordering of diagnostic tests to evaluate vertigo. Because the differential diagnosis of vertigo may be vast and at times complex, clinicians may feel obligated to order diagnostic testing such as central nervous system (CNS) imaging or vestibular testing to rule out other causes of vertigo even when diagnostic criteria for BPPV are met. In addition, patients may expect imaging or additional testing based on the perception that such testing is required or a safer course of action in the routine management of vertigo. The guideline's current strong recommendation for CRP with its anticipated high, almost immediate symptom resolution rate is anticipated to decrease such expectations and tendencies. Informational pamphlets for patients regarding their diagnosis and expectations regarding the natural history of BPPV may ease this difficulty. Specialty clinicians may exhibit a tendency for ordering additional diagnostic testing due to a variety of factors. Clinician and patient education regarding outcomes expectations and counseling on proper follow-up may offset these issues.</p>
<p>With respect to treatment with CRP, several barriers may still need to be overcome. First, many clinicians are likely to be unfamiliar with the CRP or other treatment maneuvers. In a busy clinical setting, diagnosing physicians may be unable or unwilling to take additional time to treat BPPV at the same office visit as diagnosis. In such cases, increasing familiarity with CRP or additional training of clinicians such as audiologists, physical therapists, and other providers may facilitate patients' access to CRP. Training courses on performance of the CRP offered at clinical education meetings will also help overcome this barrier.</p>
<p>Finally, patients may seek what are perceived to be simpler solutions such as medication therapy for BPPV. Given that medication therapy has not been shown effective in the treatment of BPPV, clinicians will need to educate patients that these medications offer more harm than benefit. Additional education of patients will be required in the form of handouts or brochures that inform patients of the risks associated with symptomatic BPPV, including risks for falls, recurrence of BPPV, and treatment options. Algorithms for fall assessment and home safety assessment will allow clinicians to stratify patients about these risks.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant&rsquo;s previously established "stake" in an issue.</p>
