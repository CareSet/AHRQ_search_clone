<p><strong>Strength of the Recommendations Rating Scheme</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force used methodologies endorsed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Guidelines Committee to assign a strength category to each recommendation in this review. Linking evidence to recommendations through the use of evidentiary tables has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the AANS, and the CNS. This process validates and supports the relationship between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations. Demonstrating the highest degree of clinical certainty, Class I evidence is used to support recommendations of the strongest type, defined as Level I recommendations. Level II recommendations reflect a moderate degree of clinical certainty and are supported by Class II evidence or a strong consensus of Class III evidence. Level III recommendations denote clinical uncertainty, which is supported by inconclusive or conflicting evidence or expert opinion.</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force worked with a research librarian and methodologist to assist with the formulation of search terms and strategies used to search the US National Library of Medicine PubMed/MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant literature published between January 1966 and March 2012.</p>
<p>Four to five Task Force members used the article inclusion/exclusion criteria described below to screen abstracts and provide a list of relevant articles for a full-text review. Each Task Force member was blinded to the lists of abstracts provided by others. Staff compiled all lists together for review and final approval by all Task Force members.</p>
<p>The searches were supplemented with manual screenings of bibliographies from all retrieved articles. In addition, the bibliographies of potentially relevant systematic reviews were screened for potentially relevant articles. All literature identified either by searches of the electronic database or by manual searches were subject to the article inclusion/exclusion criteria listed below. Specific search strategies used by Task Force members are provided below.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were retrieved and included as evidence to support the topics discussed in this review if they met specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. These criteria were also applied to articles provided by Task Force members who supplemented the electronic database searches with articles obtained from manual searches of bibliographies from the original articles. To reduce bias, the criteria were specified before conducting the literature searches. For the purposes of the systematic review and guidelines, articles that did not meet the following criteria were <em>not</em> deemed evidence and were not considered as potential evidence to support the topics and clinical recommendations.</p>
<p>To be included in the review, an article had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies that combined results in patients (younger than 18 years of age) who had congenital and acquired hydrocephalus with results in patients with "normal" pressure hydrocephalus were excluded if the study enrolled fewer than 80% of the target patient population. </li>
    <li>Studies that enrolled mixed patient populations were included only if separate results were reported for the target population. The results of the target population were the only results considered as evidence to support the recommendations. </li>
    <li>The study was a full article report of a clinical study. </li>
    <li>The study was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or a commentary. </li>
    <li>Prospective case series had to report baseline values. </li>
    <li>Case series studies with nonconsecutive enrollment of patients were excluded. </li>
    <li>Studies had to have appeared in a peer-reviewed publication or a registry report. </li>
    <li>Studies had to enroll at least 10 patients for each distinct outcome that was measured. If a comparative study, a minimum enrollment of five patients per treatment arm for each outcome was necessary. </li>
    <li>The study involved humans. </li>
    <li>The study was published in or after 1966. </li>
    <li>The study presented results quantitatively. </li>
    <li>The study did not involve "in vitro" or "biomechanical" data or results obtained in cadavers. </li>
    <li>The study was published in English. </li>
    <li>Papers reporting the results of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or guidelines developed by others were excluded. </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles presenting systematic reviews or meta-analyses conducted by others, as well as guidelines developed by others, were not included as evidence to support this review due to differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria between those specified in such articles and those established by the Task Force. Although such articles were not included as evidence to support the review, they were recalled for full-text review so that the Task Force could conduct manual searches of the articles' bibliographies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Search Strategy for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force searched the US National Library of Medicine (PubMed/MEDLINE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the period January 1966 through March 2012 using strategies listed below. The inclusion and exclusion criteria adhered to the protocol are outlined above.</p>

<p><strong>Search Results</strong></p>
<p>A total of 81 abstracts were screened and 18 full-text articles listed in the databases were retrieved for review (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The selection for review was based on the determination of evidence data relevant to the question of the effect of treatment on ventricle size. An examination of the reference lists of these 18 full-text articles yielded 4 additional articles that warranted full-text review. All 22 articles were read and reviewed in detail by the full Task Force. Sixteen articles were excluded based on predefined criteria. Six articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and form the basis for the evidentiary tables in this recommendation.</p></div></p>

<p>An evidentiary table was constructed to facilitate data review and analysis by the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines Task Force.</p>
<p>For each article included in the evidentiary table, the study type, summary findings, and major conclusions were recorded, and a preliminary data class was assigned. The Task Force met to discuss the ranking of the evidence and the classification of data. Recommendations then were made based on the strength of the data in the evidentiary table.

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The recommendations contained in this guideline deliberately eschew the use of expert opinion, relying strictly on information available in the literature. Studies have reported that expert opinions may not use evaluable evidence, if the papers containing that evidence do not support the "expert" point of view. Throughout the development of these guidelines, the Task Force used evidence-based methodologies and adhered to strict criteria that had been defined a priori as specified by the Institute of Medicine's standards for conducting systematic reviews and clinical evidence-based guidelines.</p>
<p>This effort was begun by a small study group that convened at the Pediatric Section Annual Meeting in Austin, Texas, in 2011. At that time the basic topics were considered, and over the course of several months these were further refined. Members of the Task Force involved in the creation of this document were recruited from a variety of institutions and subspecialty disciplines in an effort to have as broad a representation of opinions and expertise as possible.</p>
<p>The Task Force followed protocols established by the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the&nbsp;Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). A conscientious effort was also made to be sure that conflict of interest was avoided. Members who had published extensively in certain areas were mindfully assigned to evaluate evidence in other topics. Every effort was made to ensure that the work product would be transparent and trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Process Overview</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force and the Pediatric Section of the AANS/CNS conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of hydrocephalus in infants and children. Additional details of the systematic review are provided below. During the development process, the panel participated in a series of conference calls and meetings. Multiple iterations of the written review were conducted by individuals in the Task Force and various AANS/CNS committees.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Clinical Topics</strong></p>
<p>The goals of this effort were to discern the most effective strategies for a variety of hydrocephalus-related problems, including acquired hydrocephalus of the premature neonate. The Task Force also considered the use of technical adjuvants such as antibiotic-impregnated catheters, endoscopic placement of shunt catheters, electromagnetic guidance for shunt catheter placement, and ultrasound guidance for shunt catheter placement. It was hoped that these adjuvants would lead to improvements in outcome and a reduction in the frequency of revision.</p>
<p>Complications associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts and endoscopic third ventriculostomies are known, and these interventions' effects and long-term successes are useful to evaluate. Complications associated with infection are of particular significance. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of infection occupies a significant portion of the hydrocephalus literature. Finally, the correlation of ventricle size to outcome in a child is a source of great interest as an indicator of the success of the intervention.</p>
<p>Following the identification of hydrocephalus-related problems, the Task Force developed preliminary recommendations that were formatted similarly to the PICO (patients, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes) formula to aid in the determination of the overall scope of the review and the terminology used to formulate the literature search strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Voting on the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force used a structured voting technique to finalize and approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of the recommendations presented in this review. The voting technique is referred to as the "nominal group technique." This technique includes up to 3 rounds of voting using secret ballots to ensure that each Task Force member is blinded to the responses of other Task Force members. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. During the course of editing and finalizing the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described earlier. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p>
<p>See Fig. 1 in the methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for an outline of the key steps in the process of developing these clinical practice guidelines.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of the Recommendations Rating Scheme</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force used methodologies endorsed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Guidelines Committee to assign a strength category to each recommendation in this review. Linking evidence to recommendations through the use of evidentiary tables has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the AANS, and the CNS. This process validates and supports the relationship between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations. Demonstrating the highest degree of clinical certainty, Class I evidence is used to support recommendations of the strongest type, defined as Level I recommendations. Level II recommendations reflect a moderate degree of clinical certainty and are supported by Class II evidence or a strong consensus of Class III evidence. Level III recommendations denote clinical uncertainty, which is supported by inconclusive or conflicting evidence or expert opinion.</p></div></p>

<p>Topic subtask forces were created from the larger Task Force. Each subtask force took part in the literature selection, review of the literature, creation of the evidence tables, and creation and editing of the final review. The final draft review was then circulated to the entire Task Force for feedback, discussion, and, ultimately, approval.</p>
<p>Following Task Force approval, the completed systematic review was presented to the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) for consideration and recommendation of endorsement on behalf of the CNS Executive Committee and the AANS Board of Directors. As part of the evaluation process, the JGC reviewers could provide input on the content and methodologies used to create the systematic review.</p></div></p>

    <li>This clinical systematic review of and evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus were developed by a physician volunteer task force. The articles contained therein are provided as an educational tool based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information as well as accepted approaches to treatment. They are not intended to be a fixed protocol because some patients may require more or less treatment. Patient care and treatment should always be based on a clinician's independent medical judgment given individual clinical circumstances. The information in the guidelines reflects the current state of knowledge at the time of the project's completion. The presentations are designed to provide an accurate review of the subject matter that is covered. These guidelines are disseminated with the understanding that the recommendations of the authors and consultants who have collaborated in their development are not meant to replace individualized care and treatment advice from patients' physicians. If medical advice or assistance is required, the services of a competent physician should be sought. </li>
    <li>The proposals contained in these guidelines may not be suitable for use in all circumstances. The choice to implement any particular recommendation contained in these guidelines must be made by a managing physician in light of each patient's particular situation and on the basis of existing resources. </li>
