                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature search strategies were developed by initially creating lists of known interventions for oral and gastrointestinal mucositis. The organizers produced the lists and received feedback from the section heads regarding intervention coverage. The research librarian then created search statements which linked the intervention keywords together with keywords related to cancer, its treatment and mucosal injury. Searches were then conducted through the OVID interface to MEDLINE and limited to human research published in English. For mucositis clinical interventions, all papers indexed in MEDLINE before 31 December 2010 were included in the review. This approach identified over 8,000 articles. In addition to database searches, the reference lists of previous guidelines papers and Cochrane meta-analyses were searched for any additional studies. Access to specific section searches is available on request from the authors.</p>
<p>Due to the large number and diverse range of interventions, the reviewers and articles were organized into 8 clinical sections. One section focused on gastrointestinal mucositis and 7 sections examined the following classes of interventions for oral mucositis: 1) basic oral care; 2) growth factors and cytokines; 3) anti-inflammatory agents; 4) antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics, and analgesics; 5) laser and other light therapy; 6) cryotherapy; and 7) natural and miscellaneous agents. Each of the 8 sections had a section head, &ge;1 co-section heads, and 5 to 10 reviewers. All participants were calibrated to ensure consistency in the application of the review criteria. In addition, reviewers and section heads were provided with role-specific written instructions and a manual detailing the procedures. Each article was independently reviewed by 2 reviewers.</p>
<p>The output of the search strategies were exported into Endnote libraries. An Endnote library containing the articles identified was sent to each section head to select papers for retrieval. Section heads removed articles which did not meet specified inclusion criteria and returned the updated libraries to the organizers. Standard flow charts were provided to control numbers of included and excluded studies as suggested in the "PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate health care interventions: explanation and elaboration." The workflow for the review is shown in Figure 1 in the original guideline document. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Forms and Calibration</strong></p>
<p>To ensure consistency in data extraction, quality assessment and data synthesis, a series of manuals and instructions files were developed and delivered to all involved. These included an overall instructions manual, and separate instructions for reviewers, and instructions for section heads. Forms developed for this process included an Excel review form for individual reviewers, and a separate Excel form for the section heads to complete.</p>
<p>Each reviewer and section head/co-head also underwent calibration. The calibration consisted of blinded review of the paper by Silva et al. (2010), a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating low-level laser therapy for prevention of oral mucositis, before receiving the calibration key with standardised responses. According to this key, the reviewers were able to adjust future reviews. In addition, calibration teleconferences were conducted to discuss and ensure correct usage of the electronic review forms.</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction and Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Each paper was independently reviewed by two reviewers. Each reviewer extracted up to 66 fields of data per paper and entered them in the reviewer form. The section head received two separate review forms for each paper. The section head then combined the two reviews into one final review in the section heads Excel form. Discrepancies in any field between the two reviewers were resolved by the section head, by reference to the publication and/or discussion with reviewers, as appropriate. In another sheet of the section head form, data from all the different papers for each intervention were put together so that the overall data for each intervention could be evaluated. In yet another sheet of the section head form, the most critical fields needed for guideline development were entered. Interventions were separated based on (1) the aim of the intervention: prevention or treatment of mucositis; (2) the treatment setting: radiotherapy, chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy or high-dose conditioning therapy for hematopoietic stem cell transplant and (3) the route of administration of the intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria Used to Evaluate Literature</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the reviewed literature was assessed by identifying flaws in study design and methods as part of the data extraction process. Identification of flaws in study design and reporting followed the guidelines published by Hadorn et al. This allowed reviewers to assign major and minor flaws to each study (see Table 1 in the methodology companion [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). As part of the data extraction process, each reviewer identified major and minor flaws in the reviewed papers. In case of discrepancy between the two reviewers, the respective section head/co-head made the final decision on the list of major and minor flaws for each study. Less than 5 % of all studies reviewed were found to have no major flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment of a Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Once the major and minor flaws in each paper were identified, the overall body of evidence for a given intervention was assessed. Based on this, the section head assigned a level of evidence for each paper and for each intervention for each specific indication (prevention or treatment of mucositis) and route of administration, in each population. The assigning of a level of evidence was based on criteria published by Somerfield et al. (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). These criteria allocate levels of evidence based on the type of study and according to whether or not a study is "well-designed". In order to minimize subjectivity in determining whether a study is well-designed or not, we defined a "well-designed study" as a study with no major flaws, per the Hadorn criteria. If a study did not meet this definition of well designed, it was assigned a level of evidence one level below what it would have received if it had no major flaws. For example, a single RCT with no major flaws was assigned level II; however, if it had one or more major flaws, it was assigned level III. The overall body of evidence for an intervention was assigned with the level of evidence of the highest-ranking individual paper available for that intervention. For example, if there were three papers for a given intervention, one RCT with major flaws (level III) and two case&ndash;control studies with major flaws (level IV), an overall level of evidence of III was assigned for that intervention. An exception to this rule was the rare situation in which there were two or more well-designed RCTs (level II) for an intervention. In this case, an overall level of evidence of I was assigned for the intervention.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Committee Organization</strong></p>
<p>The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) Mucositis Study Group (MSG) was formed in 1998. In 2010, all academic members of the MSG were invited to participate in the present update. Two independent observers and a research librarian were also invited to participate in the update process. Additional personnel were recruited to retrieve and organize the large number of research papers needing review. All together, almost 100 people were involved in the effort. To provide structure to the large committee, it was organized hierarchically to include an organizer, co-organizers, section heads, co-section heads and reviewers. Each section consisted of a section head, one or two co-section heads and five to ten reviewers.</p>
<p>The role of the organizer was to oversee the whole process and ultimately translate the aims into action by the sections. The co-organizers were responsible for managing the sections (allocated half each) and providing day to day communication between the tiers. The section heads were allocated to one section each, according to previous guidelines experience and research interest, and were invited to name section co-heads. The role of the section head was to allocate papers to each reviewer in their group, collect and cross check reviews, provide summaries of the results and generate provisional guidelines, while the co-section head provided assistance in this role. The role of the reviewers was to conduct quality reviews of all papers allocated to them, and complete the standardised review form, before returning these to their section head. The two independent observers were present at the Guidelines Update Meeting to provide input and ensure transparency and consistency during development of guidelines. The research librarian constructed the literature searches and conducted the database searches with input from the organizer and co-organizers.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The evidence level for each intervention facilitated guideline development. Based on the methodology described in Somerfield et al. (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field), guidelines were assigned to one of three possible categories: Recommendation, Suggestion or No Guideline Possible. Specifically, level I or II evidence was required to form a recommendation, which could only be achieved by one or more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without any major flaws. A suggestion could be formed using level III or lower evidence. However, in practice, a suggestion was only created when more than one study existed for the intervention in the specific setting. If only one study existed, or if there was no panel consensus on the interpretation of the literature, no suggestion was possible. Furthermore, any intervention that showed evidence in the literature of worsening mucositis or inducing severe side effects was noted specifically by the section head and the risk&ndash;benefit ratio was discussed by the wider group. In practice, this could be one of the reasons for the development of a guideline against the use of an agent. Directions for clinical practice were specified based on the aim, setting and administration for each intervention. The provisional guidelines were discussed at a Guidelines Update Meeting attended by over 60 members of the committee and two independent observers. Committee consensus was achieved before finalizing guidelines.</p></div></p>

    <li>These guidelines refer to the use of the listed agents for the specific indication listed (i.e., the prevention or treatment of mucositis or related symptoms). These guidelines do not apply to the use of the listed agents for other indications.

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The goal of clinical practice guidelines is to improve clinical outcomes by facilitating evidence-based care. To achieve this, it is important for the guidelines to be widely disseminated and, most importantly, adopted into routine practice. Strategies to facilitate guidelines uptake can include open-access publication of the guidelines-related articles and translations into other languages, as well as online resources, including a version suitable for viewing on a smartphone. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) is also in discussions with relevant organizations to determine how they can work together to minimize duplication of effort and promote the clinical use of supportive care guidelines. The motto of the MASCC/ISOO is "Supportive care makes excellent cancer care possible." In keeping with this, MASCC/ISOO is committed to enhancing the supportive care of oncology patients, with the goal of improving the patient experience and allowing for the delivery of optimal cancer treatment.</p>
