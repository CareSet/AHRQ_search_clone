                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: Recommendations are accompanied by suggested strategies for implementation in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What core communication skills and tasks apply at every visit, across the cancer continuum?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: Before each conversation, clinicians should review the patient's medical information, establish goals for the conversation, and anticipate the needs and responses of the patient and family (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: At the beginning of conversations with patients, clinicians should explore the patient's understanding of their disease and collaboratively set an agenda with the patient after inquiring what the patient and family wish to address and explaining what the clinician wishes to address (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: During patient visits, clinicians should engage in behaviors that actively foster trust, confidence in the clinician, and collaboration (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>: Clinicians should provide information that is timely and oriented to the patient's concerns and preferences for information. After providing information, clinicians should check for patient understanding and document important discussions in the medical record (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.5</em>: When patients display emotion through verbal or nonverbal behavior, clinicians should respond empathically (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when discussing goals of care and prognosis?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Clinicians should provide diagnostic and prognostic information that is tailored to the patient's needs and that provides hope and reassurance without misleading the patient (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: Clinicians should reassess a patient's goals, priorities, and desire for information whenever a significant change in the patient's care is being considered (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.3</em>: Clinicians should provide information in simple and direct terms (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.4</em>: When providing bad news, clinicians should take additional steps to address the needs and responses of patients (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when discussing treatment options (including best supportive care) and clinical trials?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: Before discussing specific treatment options with the patient, clinicians should clarify the goals of treatment (cure v prolongation of survival v improved quality of life) so that the patient understands likely outcomes and can relate the goals of treatment to their goals of care (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: When reviewing treatment options with patients, clinicians should provide information about the potential benefits and burdens of any treatment (proportionality) and check the patient's understanding of these benefits and burdens (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: Clinicians should discuss treatment options in a way that preserves patient hope, promotes autonomy, and facilitates understanding (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4</em>: Clinicians should make patients aware of all treatment options, including clinical trials and a sole focus on palliative care. When appropriate, clinicians should discuss the option of initiating palliative care simultaneously with other treatment modalities. If clinical trials are available, clinicians should start treatment discussions with standard treatments available off trial and then move to a discussion of applicable clinical trials if the patient is interested (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when discussing end-of-life care?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.1</em>: Clinicians should use an organized framework to guide the bidirectional communication about end-of-life care with patients and families (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.2</em>: Clinicians should initiate conversations about patients' end-of-life preferences early in the course of incurable illness and readdress this topic periodically based on clinical events or patient preferences (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.3</em>: Clinicians should explore how a patient's culture, religion, or spiritual belief system affects their end-of-life decision making or care preferences (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.4</em>: Clinicians should recognize and respond empathically to grief and loss among patients, families, and themselves. Clinicians should refer patients and families to psychosocial team members (e.g., social workers, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and clergy) when appropriate (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.5</em>: Clinicians should identify and suggest local resources to provide robust support to patients, families, and loved ones transitioning to end-of-life care (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use to facilitate family involvement in care?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: Clinicians should suggest family and/or caregiver involvement in discussions (with patient consent) early in the course of the illness for support and discussion about goals of care (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2</em>: Determine if a formal family meeting in a hospital or outpatient setting is indicated at important junctures in care. When possible, ensure that patients, their designated surrogates, and desired medical professionals are present (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use when there are barriers to communication such as language differences and/or low literacy or numeracy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.1</em>: For families who do not share a common language with the clinician, use a medical interpreter rather than a family interpreter (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.2</em>: For patients with low health literacy, focus on the most important points, use plain language, and check frequently for understanding (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.3</em>: For patients with low health numeracy, use pictographs or other visual aids, when available, and describe absolute risk rather than relative risk (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should clinicians discuss cost of care with patients?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em>: Clinicians should explore whether cost of care is a concern for patients with cancer (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What communication skills and tasks may clinicians use to help meet the needs of underserved populations, racial and ethnic minority patients, and other patients from groups that have experienced discrimination historically?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8.1</em>: Enter clinical encounters with a sense of curiosity, aware that any patient and family, regardless of their background, may have beliefs, experiences, understandings, and expectations that are different from the clinician's (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8.2</em>: Avoid assumptions about sexual orientation and gender identity and use nonjudgmental language when discussing sexuality and sexual behavior (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8.3</em>: Remain aware that members of underserved or marginalized populations have an increased likelihood of having had negative past health care experiences, including feeling disrespected, alienated, or unsafe (Type of recommendation: formal consensus; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the most effective ways for clinicians to acquire communication skills?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.1</em>: Communication skills training should be based on sound educational principles and include and emphasize skills practice and experiential learning using role-play scenarios, direct observation of patient encounters, and other validated techniques (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.2</em>: For communication skills training to be most effective, it should foster practitioner self-awareness and situational awareness related to emotions, attitudes, and underlying beliefs that may affect communication as well as awareness of implicit biases that may affect decision making (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.3</em>: Facilitators of communication skills training should have sufficient training and experience to effectively model and teach the desired communication skills and facilitate experiential learning exercises (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened a multidisciplinary Expert Panel to consider the evidence and formulate the recommendations. The Expert Panel met in person and via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail. Based on the consideration of the evidence, clinical experience, and a formal consensus process, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline.</p>
<p>Because of the limited evidence available for most of the clinical questions, recommendations were developed using the ASCO modified Delphi formal consensus methodology. This process involved the drafting of recommendations by a subgroup of the Expert Panel using clinical expertise and the available evidence. The Expert Panel met in person to review the recommendations. The Expert Panel was then supplemented by additional experts, who were recruited to rate their agreement with the recommendations. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. Each recommendation had to be agreed to by at least 75% of Consensus Panel respondents to be accepted.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the original guideline document are accompanied by strategies for implementation that were developed by the Expert Panel. These strategies were not voted on by the Consensus Panel, but the Consensus Panel was invited to comment on them. The Expert Panel also indicated the strength of each recommendation. For the evidence-based recommendations, the strength of the recommendation was driven by quality of the evidence. For the consensus recommendations, the strength of the recommendation was based on the opinion of the Expert Panel.</p></div></p>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>. ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.</p>

All members of the Expert Panel completed ASCO's disclosure form, which requires disclosure of financial and other interests, including relationships with commercial entities that are reasonably likely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impact as a result of promulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; stock or other ownership; honoraria, consulting or advisory role; speaker's bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, expenses; and other relationships.
