<p>Isthmic spondylolisthesis is the anterior translation of one lumbar vertebra relative to the next caudal segment as a result of an abnormality in the pars interarticularis. When symptomatic, this causes a variable clinical syndrome of back and/or lower extremity pain, and may include varying degrees of neurologic deficits at or below the level of the injury. <em>Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p><strong>What is the likelihood that spondylolysis (unilateral and/or bilateral, identified in adolescence or adulthood) will progress to become a symptomatic spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>Spondylolisthesis occurs in 40% to 66% of patients with bilateral spondylolysis. Spondylolisthesis is unlikely to occur in patients with unilateral spondylolysis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis and Imaging</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the most appropriate physical examination findings consistent with the diagnosis of isthmic spondylolisthesis in adult patients?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of palpation in the physical exam diagnosis of adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>Approximately half of adult patients with symptomatic isthmic spondylolisthesis will have a positive straight leg test on examination. <em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p><strong>In adult patients, what symptoms or clinical presentation are associated with the diagnosis of isthmic spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with symptomatic isthmic spondylolisthesis, most patients present with low back pain and at least half present radicular lower extremity pain. <em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p><strong>What are the most appropriate diagnostic tests for adult isthmic spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>There is a relative paucity of high quality studies on imaging in adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. It is the opinion of the work group that in adult patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with isthmic spondylolisthesis, standing plain radiographs, with or without oblique views or dynamic radiographs, be considered as the most appropriate, noninvasive test to confirm the presence of isthmic spondylolisthesis. In the absence of a reliable diagnosis on plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scan is considered the most reliable diagnostic test to diagnose a defect of the pars interarticularis. In adult patients with radiculopathy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered. <em>Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>MRI is suggested to identify neuroforaminal stenosis in adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of MRI to differentiate isthmic versus degenerative spondylolisthesis in adult patients. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of discography to evaluate adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>CT may be considered as an option to diagnose isthmic spondylolisthesis in adult patients. <em>Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in evaluating isthmic spondylolisthesis in adult patients. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>In adult patients, what is the relationship between the radiological grade of isthmic spondylolisthesis and expected clinical presentation?</strong></p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.</p>
<p><strong>How frequently do adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis have abnormal findings of their sagittal spinopelvic alignment, sacral alignment and spinopelvic parameters?</strong></p>
<p>Adult patients with a diagnosis of isthmic spondylolisthesis have a higher pelvic incidence, sacral slope, pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis compared to patients without isthmic spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcome Measures for Medical/Interventional and Surgical Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the appropriate outcome measures for the treatment of adult isthmic spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>

<p>Trained guideline participants were asked to submit a list of clinical questions that the guideline should address. The proposed questions were compiled into a master list, which was then circulated to each member for review and comment. A conference call was held to review comments and condense and refine the draft clinical question list. The draft clinical question list was then submitted to the North American Spine Society (NASS) Health Policy and Research Councils for review. The councils submitted additional questions that may be useful for health policy or research purposes and approved the master list.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Identification of Search Terms and Parameters</strong></span></p>
<p>One of the most crucial elements of evidence analysis is the comprehensive literature search. Thorough assessment of the literature is the basis for the review of existing evidence and the formulation of evidence-based recommendations. In order to ensure a thorough literature search, NASS has instituted a Literature Search Protocol (see Appendix E in the original guideline document) which has been followed to identify literature for evaluation in guideline development. In keeping with the Literature Search Protocol, work group members have identified appropriate search terms and parameters to direct the literature search. Specific search strategies, including search terms, parameters and databases searched, are documented in the technical report that accompanies this guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Completion of the Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>Once each work group identified search terms/parameters, the literature search was implemented by a medical/research librarian at InfoNOW at the University of Minnesota, consistent with the Literature Search Protocol. Following these protocols ensures that NASS recommendations (1) are based on a thorough review of relevant literature; (2) are truly based on a uniform, comprehensive search strategy; and (3) represent the current best research evidence available. NASS maintains a search history in Endnote, for future use or reference.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Members have independently developed evidentiary tables summarizing study conclusions, identifying strengths and weaknesses and assigning levels of evidence. In order to systematically control for potential biases, at least two work group members have reviewed each article selected and independently assigned levels of evidence to the literature using the North American Spine Society (NASS) levels of evidence. Any discrepancies in scoring have been addressed by two or more reviewers. Final ratings are completed at a final meeting or Web conference of all section workgroup members including the section chair and the guideline chair. The consensus level was then assigned to the article. Multi-diagnosis studies that did not include sub-group analysis of isthmic spondylolisthesis patients failed to meet inclusion criteria and were excluded from the guideline.</p>
<p>As a final step in the evidence analysis process, members have identified and documented gaps in the evidence to educate guideline readers about where evidence is lacking and help guide further needed research by NASS and other societies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Levels of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>In evaluating studies as to levels of evidence for this guideline, the study design was interpreted as establishing only a potential level of evidence. As an example, a therapeutic study designed as a randomized controlled trial would be considered a potential Level I study. The study would then be further analyzed as to how well the study design was implemented and significant shortcomings in the execution of the study would be used to downgrade the levels of evidence for the study's conclusions. In the example cited previously, reasons to downgrade the results of a potential Level I randomized controlled trial to a Level II study would include, among other possibilities: an underpowered study (patient sample too small, variance too high), inadequate randomization or masking of the group assignments and lack of validated outcome measures.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of studies were reviewed several times in answering different questions within this guideline. How a given question was asked might influence how a study was evaluated and interpreted as to its level of evidence in answering that particular question. For example, a randomized controlled trial reviewed to evaluate the differences between the outcomes of surgically treated versus untreated patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy might be a well designed and implemented Level I therapeutic study. This same study, however, might be classified as providing Level II prognostic evidence if the data for the untreated controls were extracted and evaluated prognostically.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identification of Work Groups</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams were assigned to work groups and assigned specific clinical questions to address. Because NASS is comprised of surgical, medical and interventional specialists, it is imperative to the guideline development process that a cross-section of NASS membership is represented on the work group. This also helps to ensure that the potential for inadvertent biases in evaluating the literature and formulating recommendations is minimized.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulation of Evidence-Based Recommendations and Incorporation of Expert Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Work groups held Web conferences and face-to-face meetings to discuss the evidence-based answers to the clinical questions, the grades of recommendations and the incorporation of expert consensus. Expert consensus was incorporated only where Level I to IV evidence is insufficient and the work group has deemed that a recommendation is warranted. Transparency in the incorporation of consensus is crucial, and all consensus-based recommendations made in this guideline very clearly indicate that Level I to IV evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation and that the recommendation is based only on expert consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Development Process</strong></p>
<p>Voting on guideline recommendations was conducted using a modification of the nominal group technique in which each work group member independently and anonymously ranked a recommendation on a scale ranging from 1 ("extremely inappropriate") to 9 ("extremely appropriate"). Consensus was obtained when at least 80% of work group members ranked the recommendation as 7, 8 or 9. When the 80% threshold was not attained, up to three rounds of discussion and voting were held to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not resolved after these rounds, no recommendation was adopted.</p>
<p>After the recommendations were established, work group members developed the guideline content, addressing the literature supporting the recommendations.</p></div></p>

    <li>This guideline does not represent a "standard of care," nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol. It is anticipated that there will be patients who will require less or more treatment than the average. It is also acknowledged that in atypical cases, treatment falling outside this guideline will sometimes be necessary. This guideline should not be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration of intervention. Treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and doctor's professional judgment and experience. This document is designed to function as a guideline and should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services. This guideline is not intended to expand or restrict a health care provider's scope of practice or to supersede applicable ethical standards or provisions of law. </li>
    <li>This clinical guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding or other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution. </li>
