</ul>
<p>For all databases, search terms included the term 'everolimus'. For MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and Science Citation Index, searches were also limited to second line or recurrent advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer. No language, study or date restrictions were employed, nor were any search filters used.</p>
<p>The search strategies employed appear to be comprehensive. The ERG also conducted its own searches of MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), ASCO and SABCS on 5 December 2012 and did not identify any additional potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p><em>Mixed Treatment Comparison</em></p>
<p>A series of searches was undertaken by the manufacturer on 22 March 2012 to identify systematic reviews and trials which could be used to provide indirect comparisons. The first searches were undertaken in the following databases:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (OvidSP) </li>
    <li>EMBASE (OvidSP) </li>
    <li>The Cochrane Library (Wiley Interscience) </li>

</ul>
<p>A second series of searches were undertaken on 26 March 2012 in the Cochrane Library databases via the Wiley Interscience interface, specifically the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the DARE and HTA database. Searches were also undertaken on the National Horizon Scanning Centre website and the NICE website.</p>
<p>For all databases, search terms were limited to identify breast cancer studies and, where databases allowed, attempts were made to limit the searches to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews/meta-analyses. No language, study or drug restrictions were employed. Date restrictions were only employed for searches of the DARE and HTA databases (to 2010-2012 publications).</p>
<p>The search strategies employed appear to be appropriate. The ERG also conducted its own searches of the Cochrane Library (Wiley Interscience), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid SP) on 16 November 2012 and did not identify any additional potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p><em>Na&iuml;ve Chained Indirect Analysis</em></p>
<p>In order to conduct the 'na&iuml;ve chained indirect analysis', a 'rapid search' of the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE and HTA databases) was conducted to identify systematic reviews and health technology assessments of chemotherapy and advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The precise detail of the search strategy is not provided in the manufacturer's submission (MS) but it is stated that it 'was designed to be sensitive in order to identify all systematic reviews and health technology assessments about advanced or metastatic breast cancer' and, for DARE and HTA, limited to reviews published from 2010 to 2012.</p>
<p>It is not possible to assess the appropriateness of the search strategy employed from the level of detail provided. However the ERG conducted its own searches of the Cochrane Library (Wiley Interscience), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid SP) on 16 November 2012 and did not identify any additional potentially relevant reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Systematic Review</em></p>
<p>The MS presented the inclusion and exclusion criteria for its systematic review. These are reproduced in the Table below.</p>

</table>
<p><em>Mixed Treatment Comparison</em></p>
<p>The search results were assessed for relevance to drug interventions for women with HR-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer. To achieve a network, the following eligibility criteria were relaxed for record selection from the results of the second searches:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>HER2-negative status: trials with mixed populations and where the HER2 status was not reported were considered eligible. </li>
    <li>Treatment lines other than second line were considered eligible. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Na&iuml;ve Chained Indirect Analysis</em></p>
<p>Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria for the 'na&iuml;ve chained indirect analysis' were not presented in the MS. However, it is stated that having identified potentially relevant reviews, these 'were then sifted to remove those reviews that were not about drug interventions for advanced or metastatic breast cancer: surgery, radiotherapy, non-drug treatments, screening, prevention, etc.' Without greater detail, it is not possible to comment on the appropriateness of the inclusion and exclusion criteria employed. However, the ERG does not believe that any relevant reviews were excluded.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Objective of the Manufacturer's Cost-effectiveness Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer carried out a search to identify studies reporting the cost-effectiveness of everolimus in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) breast cancer who had already received endocrine therapy.</p>
<p>The databases searched included: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, EconLit and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). All searches were carried out on 8 and 9 March 2012. The search strategy used did not include an economic search filter because scoping searches had indicated that the amount of literature for everolimus was very small. The search strategies comprised the drug name in combination with search terms for advanced or metastatic breast cancer. No date or language limits were applied. Full details of the search strategies, as well as the databases and resources searched, are provided in the MS.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions of the Cost-effectiveness Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer's search to identify studies reporting the cost-effectiveness of everolimus in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) breast cancer who had already received endocrine therapy did not identify any relevant cost-effectiveness studies. The ERG is satisfied with the manufacturer's search strategy and is reasonably confident that the manufacturer did not miss any relevant published articles.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p><em>Systematic Review</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer described the data it planned to extract for its systematic review in the manufacturer's submission (MS). These data appear to be appropriate. It is not clear whether the data extracted from any study was cross-checked. For the main trial (BOLERO-2) that provided the majority of the evidence in the MS, the ERG has cross-checked much of the data extracted with the published paper and the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medical Products for Human Use European Public Assessment Report (EMA CHMP EPAR). It is difficult to determine if any relevant data has not been extracted without access to the Clinical Study Report but, based on the information provided in the protocol and statistical analysis plan, it appears that the majority of the analyses that were planned were reported in the MS. However, these were not always reported for the most recent data cut off (18 months). In its clarification letter to the manufacturer, the ERG therefore requested the following data at 18 months:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Duration of exposure to study treatment </li>
    <li>Time to response </li>
    <li>Duration of response </li>
    <li>Treatment received after discontinuation </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these data were provided by the manufacturer, although all were deemed to be commercial in confidence (CIC) and therefore, wherever possible, the ERG has attempted to report only data that are not CIC.</p>
<p><em>Mixed Treatment Comparison</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer described the data it planned to extract for its mixed treatment comparison in the MS. These data appear to be appropriate. However, it is not clear whether the data extracted from any study was cross-checked. The ERG has cross-checked the data extracted with the published papers (and where applicable, previous documentation for NICE single technology appraisals [STAs] and Conference slides) for each study and in some instances, identified some minor errors; where appropriate, these have been corrected in the tables throughout the ERG report.</p>
<p><em>Na&iuml;ve Chained Indirect Analysis</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer does not describe its data extraction strategy for the 'na&iuml;ve chained indirect analysis' in the MS. However, it would appear that, in addition to the data from the TAMRAD study extracted for the manufacturer's systematic review, only the value of the hazard ratio for the comparison between chemotherapy and endocrine therapy from another systematic review by Wilcken et al. was extracted. It is not clear whether the data extracted was cross-checked. However, the ERG has cross-checked the extracted data and has not identified any errors.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p><em>Systematic Review</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer conducted an assessment of risk of bias for studies included in its systematic review. It was conducted by using a checklist recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and presented in the MS. The ERG conducted its own assessment of risk of bias for these studies using the same checklist and largely reached conclusions that were similar to those of the manufacturer.</p>
<p><em>Mixed Treatment Comparison</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer conducted an assessment of risk of bias for all included studies in the mixed treatment analysis. It was conducted by using a checklist recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration and presented in the MS. The ERG conducted its own assessment of risk of bias for these studies using the same checklist and reached conclusions which were similar to those of the manufacturer.</p>
<p><em>Na&iuml;ve Chained Indirect Analysis</em></p>
<p>No assessment of risk of bias was specifically presented for the 'na&iuml;ve chained indirect analysis' although the primary studies included did not differ from those in the systematic review or mixed treatment comparison and so had already been assessed for risk of bias. However, it is not clear if the quality of the identified systematic review was assessed.</p>
<p>Refer to the appendices in the ERG report for information on assessment of risk of bias for studies included in the MS.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p><em>Systematic Review</em></p>
<p>Because the studies identified for inclusion into the systematic review had different interventions and comparators, the manufacturer appropriately synthesised the data by reporting on each trial individually and did not attempt a meta-analysis.</p>
<p><em>Mixed Treatment Comparison</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer performed mixed treatment comparison analyses on two outcomes; progression-free survival (PFS or time to progression [TTP]) and overall survival (OS). Log hazard ratios were used to inform the analyses, and the results were presented as hazard ratios for fulvestrant versus exemestane and fulvestrant versus everolimus in combination with exemestane. The ERG believes this was the most appropriate way to synthesise the data.</p>
<p><em>Na&iuml;ve Chained Indirect Analysis</em></p>
<p>No data synthesis of the 'na&iuml;ve chained indirect analysis' was undertaken in the clinical section of the MS. The findings from this analysis were used to inform the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 4 of the ERG report for more information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>A schematic of the model structure is shown in Figure 5 of the ERG report.</p>
<p>Three health states are used to model disease progression. All patients enter the model in the Stable (PFS) health state and in each month can either progress to a 'worse' health state (i.e., from Stable to Progressed or Dead, or from Progressed to Dead) or remain in the same health state. Subsequent lines of therapy are not considered in the model.</p>
<p>The model has been developed in MS Excel and has a one month cycle length. It includes a half-cycle correction and the base case time horizon is 10 years. A discount rate of 3.5% has been used for both costs and outcomes. The perspective is that of the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity Analyses</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer undertook a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Results of their deterministic sensitivity analyses are not included in the MS. The figures in Table 33 of the ERG report have, therefore, been generated from the model by the ERG.</p>
<p>Results from the scenario analyses carried out by the manufacturer are presented in Table 34 of the ERG report. The manufacturer also undertook probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to derive the mean incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of everolimus plus exemestane compared with exemestane alone. The distributions used in the PSA are summarised in Table 35 of the ERG report.</p>
<p><strong>Model Validation and Face Validity Check</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer reports that the model was subjected to a rigorous 'pressure test' to identify potential errors. Internal validation was undertaken by varying an extensive list of inputs and comparing the impact against expected results. In addition, detailed testing of the model's formulae and functionality was undertaken. A summary of the tests conducted is provided in the MS.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 5 of the ERG report for additional information on cost-effectiveness.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the Evidence Review Group (ERG)'s critique of the manufacturer's comparison of everolimus plus exemestane and exemestane alone.</p>
<p>The Committee noted that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were most sensitive to the modelling of overall survival and progression-free survival assessment method.</p>

<p>The Committee agreed that the most plausible ICER should be based on an analysis using the following assumptions: using exponential functions to estimate progression-free survival and the non-parallel model of overall survival; omitting the adjustment factor from Beauchemin et al. (2012); using locally assessed trial data; including adverse reactions; using rates of adverse reactions as documented in the European Public Assessment Report; recalculating time on treatment; including costs of monitoring disease that has not progressed; correcting discounting and utility values for stable disease; using the utility value for 'progressed disease' from Lloyd et al. (2006); and omitting extra mortality from non-cancer causes.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that neither valuation of utility for the 'progressed disease' health state was without uncertainty, but that the data from Lloyd et al. (2006) were more appropriate than the data from Launois et al. (1997).</p>
<p><strong>Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>Although the Committee acknowledged that the mechanism of action of everolimus may offer a step change in treatment by restoring sensitivity of the tumour to endocrine therapy, it concluded that the manufacturer had not submitted convincing evidence that everolimus (plus exemestane) provides health-related quality-of-life benefits exceeding that calculated in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-effective?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the available evidence did not allow it to make any recommendations specific to subgroups of patients.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>Using local or central assessment for progression-free survival in the modelling: The Committee concluded that it was more appropriate to use effectiveness data derived from local assessment in the modelling than from central assessment because local assessment represented the primary end point of the trial, reflected clinical practice and minimised the potential for bias from informative censoring.</p>
<p>Choice of survival modelling: The Committee agreed that the manufacturer's estimated 10.5 months' survival benefit with the Weibull analysis was likely to be optimistic, and that the estimated 1.4 months' survival benefit with the ERG's exploratory parallel exponential model was likely to be pessimistic. It acknowledged that the overall survival benefit of everolimus plus exemestane is uncertain but probably lies between these estimates. The Committee noted that it is also similar to the overall survival benefit from the ERG's non parallel exponential model (4.6 months), which reflects the longer progression-free survival with everolimus plus exemestane than with exemestane alone.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the ERG's estimate of the ICER (including the patient access scheme for everolimus) of &pound;68,000 per QALY gained for everolimus plus exemestane compared with exemestane alone was more plausible than the manufacturer's base-case estimate.</p></div></p>
