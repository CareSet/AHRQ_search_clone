                    <p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Patient education</strong>. Women with breast cancer or those deemed to be at high risk for developing breast cancer (e.g., breast cancer genes 1 and 2 [<em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>] mutation carriers) should receive standardized information about breast reconstruction early in their decision making process. Patients who are to undergo either therapeutic or prophylactic mastectomy should receive detailed, individually tailored information to assist with decision making, including appropriate breast reconstruction consultation if desired. </li>
    <li><strong>Eligibility for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction</strong>. Various patient and treatment factors affect options, risks, and outcomes of breast reconstruction. Consultation with a specialist in breast reconstruction can provide a patient with a specialized treatment plan and anticipated outcomes, risks, and benefits so she can determine if breast reconstruction is appropriate for her. Factors that should be weighed when considering candidates for any method of breast reconstruction (immediate or delayed) include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Cancer factors: tumour stage and location, risk of relapse </li>
        <li>Treatment factors: prior, concurrent, or anticipated future breast cancer treatment (such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy) </li>
        <li>Patient factors: co-morbidities, body habitus, smoking status, and behavioral/ lifestyle factors </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Types of breast reconstruction</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Several types of breast reconstruction are available, including: implant-based, autologous flap and combination reconstructions (i.e., autologous with implant). </li>
        <li>There is no evidence to suggest that one type of procedure can be recommended over another. The decision as to which type of reconstruction to use should be left to the discretion of the surgeon(s) and the patient after sufficient counseling on the benefits and limitations of each procedure. Table 1 in the original guideline document presents factors which may influence the type of reconstruction to be performed. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Timing of breast reconstruction (immediate versus delayed)</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Patients undergoing prophylactic mastectomy should be considered for immediate breast reconstruction (i.e., at the time of surgery). </li>
        <li>Patients undergoing therapeutic mastectomy who <strong>do not, or are unlikely to, require post-mastectomy radiotherapy</strong> should be considered for immediate breast reconstruction. There is sufficient evidence to support the oncologic safety of immediate reconstruction in these patients. </li>
        <li>Patients for whom post-mastectomy radiotherapy is probable or uncertain should be discussed for breast reconstruction appropriateness in a multidisciplinary setting and meet pre-operatively with a radiation oncologist as needed; in general, reconstruction should be delayed until after treatment with radiation therapy has been completed. Concerns include the inability to include important structures in radiation therapy volumes, and an increase in long term fibrotic complications in both implant and autologous tissue based immediate reconstruction. </li>
        <li>On average, patients who are good candidates for reconstruction and receiving other adjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy, can be safely offered breast reconstruction with no evidence of adverse effects on the outcome of reconstruction and no clinically relevant delay in chemotherapy. </li>
        <li>Patients for whom immediate breast reconstruction is not appropriate may be considered for delayed breast reconstruction as an acceptable alternative after completion of all recommended adjuvant therapies. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Factors that enhance recovery after breast reconstruction</strong>. Irrespective of type or timing of reconstruction, recovery can be improved by adherence to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS<sup>&reg;</sup>) protocols, such as limiting pre-operative fasting, carbohydrate loading, multimodal analgesia, post-operative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, goal directed fluid therapy, early institution of post-operative feeding, early ambulation, and adequate post-discharge outpatient supports. </li>
    <li><strong>Extent of mastectomy (i.e., skin-sparing, nipple-sparing)</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Skin-sparing mastectomy is acceptable for any patient undergoing immediate breast reconstruction. </li>
        <li>Nipple-sparing mastectomy is oncologically safe for prophylactic patients, but may not be suitable for every patient based on risk of nipple necrosis. </li>
        <li>For patients with malignancy, there is no level one evidence for or against the oncologic safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM). Multidisciplinary input and discussion between the surgeons and the patient about potential additional risks such as perfusion issues and local recurrence risk associated with this approach are required. </li>
        <li>There is limited evidence around what surgical factors to consider when performing mastectomy; however, based on consensus of the guideline working group, a list of technical considerations is included in Appendix A in the original guideline document. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Risks and benefits of breast reconstruction</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Patients should be made aware that breast reconstruction is a complex, major, multi-step surgery and that complications occur. </li>
        <li>Patient expectations should be assessed prior to surgery, in order to optimize care. In addition, patients should be made aware that the final outcome may vary from patient to patient and that the reconstructive surgery will not restore the breast to its original function, appearance, or sensation. </li>
        <li>Complications can occur with each type of reconstructive procedure. Listed below are the most common complications associated with each procedure:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><strong>Autologous reconstructions</strong>: mastectomy skin necrosis, seroma, scarring, hematoma, chronic back pain, abdominal weakness, bulge, hernia, fat necrosis, partial or complete flap necrosis. There is evidence to suggest that deep inferior epigastric perforators (DIEP) flaps carry a higher risk of fat necrosis and flap loss, as compared to muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flaps. There is also evidence to suggest that donor-site morbidity (i.e., bulge formation, hernia) is lower with DIEP flaps, as compared to muscle-sparing TRAM flaps. </li>
            <li><strong>Implant-based reconstructions</strong>: mastectomy skin flap necrosis, infection, seroma, hematoma, chronic breast pain, implant rupture, tissue expander puncture, exposure or malposition, capsular contracture, and an extremely rare form of breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Careful patient evaluation for risk factors for complications is required to determine if a woman is appropriate for immediate reconstruction. It is critical to minimize the chance of delay to adjuvant chemotherapy for triple negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer, as a delay of &gt;61 days may lead to inferior breast outcomes. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Implant-based acellular dermal matrix reconstructions</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The use of human acellular dermal matrix (HADM) in immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction confers the potential benefits of improved aesthetic results, reduced rates of capsular contracture and implant malposition, and the possibility of a single-stage "direct to implant" procedure for carefully selected patients. </li>
        <li>These benefits should be weighed against the potentially higher risks of mastectomy skin necrosis, postoperative seroma, and infection in HADM-assisted prosthetic reconstruction, when compared to traditional, non HADM-assisted techniques. </li>
        <li>Based on consensus, the use of HADM in breast reconstruction should be at the discretion of the reconstructive surgeon, in consultation with the patient and oncologic team. Indications to use HADM include two-stage expander/implant reconstruction or direct-to-implant single-stage reconstruction, to gain increased control over infra- and lateral mammary fold position and ptosis. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Adjunctive autologous fat grafting (lipofilling) for contour regularities after breast reconstruction</strong>. Case control data supports the safety of lipofilling. Data from comparative studies and case reports suggest that patient satisfaction is good; however more data is needed. </li>
    <li><strong>Post-breast reconstruction surveillance</strong>. Regarding oncologic surveillance, there is no evidence to support routine screening mammography of the reconstructed breast; therefore, it is not recommended. Fat necrosis is a common and benign mammographic finding in patients with reconstructed breasts. Post-reconstruction patients with suspicious masses or symptoms should be referred to a surgeon for examination and further workup. Regarding implant surveillance, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect silent implant shell rupture, there is no evidence that radiologic screening of asymptomatic reconstructed breasts improves women's health. </li>
    <li><strong>Measuring outcomes in breast reconstruction</strong>. Clinical and patient reported outcomes can be recorded, with presently available validated instruments, at the pre-, peri- and post-operative stage to help multi-disciplinary teams deliver consistent, high quality care with minimal variability. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team, a province-wide working group of plastic surgeons, and a Knowledge Management Specialist (KMS) from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Between initial publication of this guideline in 2013 and the update in 2016, there have been four new clinical practice guidelines published that are focused exclusively on breast reconstruction and updates to five breast cancer guidelines to include recommendations on breast reconstruction. These developments have been reviewed and incorporated into this guideline where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Tables</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables generally document the following information: authors, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, study methods, and main outcomes of interest. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KMS using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="/web/20180712205422/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50670&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712205422im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p>Expert Consensus</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development and Revision History</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team. Members of the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team include medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, nurses, pathologists, psychologists, and pharmacists. Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team, a province-wide working group of plastic surgeons, and a Knowledge Management Specialist (KMS) from the Guideline Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulating Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Working Group (GWG) working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the interpretation of evidence synthesized by the KMS during the planning process blended with expert clinical experience and local context. The GWG members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution with revisions, or develop their own set of recommendations. The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the GWG and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Ideally recommendations should be presented in a standardized format explicitly detailing appropriate actions and the circumstances in which they should be applied. Wording should be such that it is possible to evaluate the compliance to each recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Foundations and Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, GURU does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Description of all known benefits and possible harms </li>
    <li>Evidence summary, quality/quantity/consistency of discussion </li>
    <li>Discussion of the role of clinical experience, theory, values and opinions in developing the recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drafting the Guideline</strong></p>
<p>After the GWG members have come to an agreement on the guideline recommendations, the KMS will complete a draft version of the guideline using a standard format. The KMS will provide working group members with the template for the GURU guideline, and seek input on the content of specific sections.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Algorithms</strong></p>
<p>A treatment algorithm is a structured multidisciplinary schematic detailing essential steps in the care of patients with a specific clinical problem. Algorithms often accompany final guidelines and help to facilitate systematic collection of clinical data that can be used to promote change in practice. Treatment algorithms are developed either simultaneously with the development of a new guideline, or <em>post hoc</em> for an existing guideline and are used as an implementation tool to improve guideline awareness and uptake.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Not applicable</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Cost Analysis</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Issues (Types of Reconstruction)</span></strong></p>
<p>American statistics from 2008 revealed a $2,860 USD difference in cost (including initial hospitalization and complications and revisions up to one year) in favor of a free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap ($14,080 USD) over an implant ($16,940 USD); however, the cost difference disappeared over time. A Canadian study comparing deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) and TRAM flap reconstructions, using a cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating medical costs (inpatient costs only) from the Ontario Ministry of Health (2002), showed that the DIEP flap was slightly more costly than the free TRAM flap ($7,026.47 versus $6,508.29) while providing similar quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to the free TRAM flap (28.88 years versus 28.53 years). It has been reported elsewhere, however, that the cost of a latissimus dorsi (LD), TRAM, or DIEP flap reconstructions, including both primary surgery and any revisions, are similar, and that any small financial benefits gained from the implant reconstruction at initial surgery will be lost over time, as patients require additional revisions. A 2015 cost analysis found initial healthcare costs at the time of surgery were greatest for autologous patients (autologous=$54,309 USD, direct-to-implant=$46,228 USD, expander/implant=$39,470 USD, p&lt;0.001), but after 3 years, the absolute difference in cost between the groups had decreased (autologous=$66,882 USD, direct-to-implant=$64,145 USD, expander/implant=$63,806 USD, p&lt;0.001). The authors credit this reduced differential to unplanned revisions being lowest among the autologous cohort (autologous=34.4%, direct-to-implant=45.9%, expander/implant=59.2%, p&lt;0.001). As such, no recommendations can be made, favoring one type of reconstruction over another from a cost perspective.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Human Acellular Dermal Matrices (HADM)</span></strong></p>
<p>Data is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions regarding the overall cost-effectiveness of HADM in breast reconstruction. A Canadian cost analysis study demonstrated that although these products are expensive, their use can result in an overall cost savings to the health care system as a result of fewer revisionary and second stage procedures. The authors emphasize the need for further randomized controlled trials to evaluate both the clinical outcomes and costs of ADM-assisted breast reconstruction. One such multicentre Canadian trial (NCT00956384) comparing HADM-assisted single stage, "direct-to-implant" reconstruction to conventional two-stage expander implant reconstruction, is underway. Outcomes measures include aesthetic outcomes, short and long term complications, and overall patient satisfaction. This trial should clarify the role of HADM in "direct-to-implant" reconstructions, and will also examine the cost-effectiveness of the procedure.</p></div></p>

                    <p>Internal Peer Review</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Method of Guideline Validation</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Review and Approval (Consensus)</span></strong></p>
<p>Once a guideline draft is complete it is necessary to ensure that the individuals who are intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review it and identify potential challenges for implementation before the guideline is published. If there is general agreement regarding best practice on a particular topic, an informal consensus process can be used to reach agreement on guideline recommendations amongst working group members and the Provincial Tumour Team members; this can be achieved through discussions at meetings, or by email and teleconference. A more formalized process may be required in some situations, including when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Guideline topic is controversial </li>
    <li>Known practice variations exist </li>
    <li>Guideline spans across multiple Tumour Teams </li>
    <li>There is a limited or inconclusive evidence available in the literature </li>
    <li>External expertise/significantly affected groups are needed </li>
</ul>
<p>A common method used to obtain formal consensus on complex issues is the Delphi process. The Guideline Resource Unit (GURU) utilizes a modified Delphi process similar to that used by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) in which successive iterations of a draft guideline/recommendation are disseminated to the Provincial Tumour Team and sometimes external experts (via an anonymous online survey tool) until consensus is reached. Prior to drafting the guideline recommendations, the Guideline Working Group (GWG) determines an appropriate response rate and an acceptable level of agreement. Based on the feedback received and the level of agreement, the GWG updates the draft guideline and presents the updated draft to the Provincial Tumour Team and any impacted groups. Once a consensus is reached, the guideline is approved by the Tumour Team Lead and is published to the Alberta Health Services Web site. Figure 2 in the GURU Handbook describes the consensus process (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For women who do undergo mastectomy, whether for therapeutic or for prophylactic reasons, the side effects of mastectomy can be significant. Anxiety and depression, poor body image, sexual issues, and phantom breast syndrome have been well-documented among patients who have undergone mastectomy. However, breast reconstruction may alleviate some of the postmastectomy distress experienced by these patients. </li>
    <li>Refer to the original guideline document for additional information on the potential benefits and harms of various types of breast reconstruction. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Complications can occur with each type of reconstructive procedure. Listed below are the most common complications associated with each procedure:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Autologous reconstructions: mastectomy skin necrosis, seroma, scarring, hematoma, chronic back pain, abdominal weakness, bulge, hernia, fat necrosis, partial or complete flap necrosis. There is evidence to suggest that deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps carry a higher risk of fat necrosis and flap loss, as compared to muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flaps. There is also evidence to suggest that donor-site morbidity (i.e., bulge formation, hernia) is lower with DIEP flaps, as compared to muscle-sparing TRAM flaps. </li>
        <li>Implant-based reconstructions: mastectomy skin necrosis, infection, seroma, hematoma, chronic breast pain, implant rupture, tissue expander puncture, exposure or malposition, capsular contracture, and an extremely rare form of breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The use of human acellular dermal matrix (HADM) has potentially higher risks of mastectomy skin necrosis, postoperative seroma, and infection, and mastectomy skin necrosis in HADM-assisted prosthetic reconstruction, when compared to traditional, non HADM-assisted techniques. </li>
    <li>The Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons (CSPS) has released a statement acknowledging the low but increased risk of ALCL in women with breast implants. </li>

    <li>In previously radiated patients, the use of tissue expanders/implants is relatively contraindicated. Current guidelines recommend autologous or combined autologous/implant reconstruction in women who have received prior irradiation to the breast, as tissue expanders and implants carries higher risk for complications. </li>
    <li>In a breast that has been previously irradiated, there is evidence which contraindicates the use of human acellular dermal matrix (HADM); a retrospective study found a tissue expander loss rate of 40.7% in previously irradiated breasts with HADM, a rate that was triple the rate in radiated breasts without HADM (13.5%). </li>
