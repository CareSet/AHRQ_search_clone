<p>The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) developed <em>a priori</em> article inclusion criteria for review. These criteria are "rules of evidence" and articles that did not meet them are, for the purposes of this guideline, not evidence.</p>
<p>To be included in the systematic reviews (and hence, in this guideline) an article had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Study must be of a carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) injury or prevention thereof </li>
    <li>Study must be published in or after 1966 for <em>surgical treatment</em>, <em>rehabilitation</em>, <em>bracing</em>, <em>prevention</em> and <em>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</em> </li>
    <li>Study must be published in or after 1966 for <em>x rays</em> and <em>non-operative treatment</em> </li>
    <li>Study must be published in or after 1966 for all others non specified </li>
    <li>Study should have 10 or more patients per group </li>
    <li>For surgical treatment a minimum of 3 months follow up duration </li>
    <li>Antibiotic prophylaxis, anticoagulations, mode of anesthesia: all follow-ups </li>
    <li>For <em>non-operative</em> treatment a minimum of 1 month </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standard Criteria for all Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Article must be a full article report of a clinical study. </li>
    <li>Retrospective non-comparative case series, medical records review, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorials, letters, and commentaries are <strong><em>excluded</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>Confounded studies (i.e., studies that give patients the treatment of interest AND another treatment) are <strong><em>excluded</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>Case series studies that have non-consecutive enrollment of patients are <strong><em>excluded</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>Controlled trials in which patients were not stochastically assigned to groups AND in which there was either a difference in patient characteristics or outcomes at baseline AND where the authors did not statistically adjust for these differences when analyzing the results are <strong><em>excluded</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>All studies of "Very Weak" strength of evidence are <strong><em>excluded</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>All studies evaluated as Level V will be <strong><em>excluded</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>Composite measures or outcomes are <strong><em>excluded</em></strong> even if they are patient-oriented. </li>
    <li>Study must appear in a peer-reviewed publication. </li>
    <li>For any included study that uses "paper-and-pencil" outcome measures (e.g., 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]), only those outcome measures that have been validated will be included </li>
    <li>For any given follow-up time point in any included study, there must be &ge;50% patient follow-up (if the follow-up is &gt;50% but &lt;80%, the study quality will be downgraded by one Level). </li>

</ul>
<p>Surrogate outcomes will only be evaluated when no patient oriented outcomes are available.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The systematic review began with a comprehensive search of the literature. Articles considered were published prior to February 27, 2015 in four electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The medical librarian conducted the search using key terms determined from the guideline development group's preliminary recommendations.</p>
<p>The electronic search was supplemented with a manual search of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications, recent systematic reviews, and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. Recalled articles are evaluated for possible inclusion based on the study selection criteria and are summarized for the guideline development group who assist with reconciling possible errors and omissions.</p>
<p>The study attrition diagram in Appendix IV (see the original guideline document) provides a detailed description of the numbers of identified abstracts and recalled and selected studies that were evaluated in the systematic review of this guideline. The search strategies used to identify the abstracts are contained in Appendix V in the original guideline document.</p></div></p>

<p>The quality of evidence is evaluated separately for each study using modified versions of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies (QUADAS) instruments. Depending on the type of study (i.e., diagnostic, prognostic, randomized control trial, or observational) the study design is evaluated using a list of standardized questions (see below for the domains evaluated for each type of study design).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Study Quality Appraisal Questions</strong></p>
<p>The following questions are used to evaluate the study quality of diagnostic study designs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Evidence Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>Only the best available evidence for any given outcome addressing a recommendation was included. Accordingly, first included was the highest quality evidence for any given outcome if it was available. In the absence of two or more occurrences of an outcome at this quality, the authors considered outcomes of the next lowest quality until at least two or more occurrences of an outcome had been acquired. For example, if there were two "moderate" quality occurrences of an outcome that addressed a recommendation, the authors did not include "low" quality occurrences of this outcome. A summary of the evidence that met the inclusion criteria, but was not best available evidence was created and can be viewed by recommendation in Appendix XII in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Diagnostic Data</strong></p>
<p>Likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the accuracy of diagnostic modalities based on two by two diagnostic contingency tables extracted from the included studies. When summary values of sensitivity, specificity, or other diagnostic performance measures were reported, estimates of the diagnostic contingency table were used to calculate LRs.</p>
<p>LRs indicate the magnitude of the change in probability of disease due to a given test result. For example, a positive LR of 10 indicates that a positive test result is 10 times more common in patients with disease than in patients without disease. LRs are interpreted according to previously published values, as seen in Table 4 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Intervention/Prevention Data</strong></p>
<p>When possible, the results were recalculated and reported in individual studies and compiled to answer the recommendations. The results of all statistical analysis conducted by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit are conducted using SAS 9.4. SAS was used to determine the magnitude, direction, and/or 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect. For data reported as means (and associated measures of dispersion) the mean difference between groups and the 95% confidence interval was calculated and a two-tailed t-test of independent groups was used to determine statistical significance. When published studies report measures of dispersion other than the standard deviation the value was estimated to facilitate calculation of the treatment effect. In studies that report standard errors or confidence intervals the standard deviation was back-calculated. In some circumstances statistical testing was conducted by the authors and measures of dispersion were not reported. In the absence of measures of dispersion, the results of the statistical analyses conducted by the authors (i.e., the p-value) are considered as evidence. For proportions, the authors report the proportion of patients that experienced an outcome along with the percentage of patients that experienced an outcome. The variance of the arcsine difference was used to determine statistical significance. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>When the data was available, meta-analyses were performed using the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird. A minimum of three studies was required for an outcome to be considered by meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I-squared statistic. Meta-analyses with I-squared values less than 50% were considered as evidence. Those with I-squared larger than 50% were not considered as evidence for this guideline. All meta-analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. The arcsine difference was used in meta-analysis of proportions. In order to overcome the difficulty of interpreting the magnitude of the arcsine difference, a summary odds ratio is calculated based on random effects meta-analysis of proportions and the number needed to treat (or harm) is calculated. The standardized mean difference was used for meta-analysis of means and magnitude was interpreted using Cohen's definitions of small, medium, and large effect.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This guideline and systematic review were prepared by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Guideline physician guideline development group (clinical experts) with the assistance of the AAOS Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Unit in the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs (methodologists) at the AAOS. To develop this guideline, the guideline development group held an introductory meeting on February 1, 2013 to establish the scope of the guideline and the systematic reviews. As the physician experts, the guideline development group defined the scope of the guideline by creating PICO Questions (i.e., population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) that directed the literature search. When necessary, these clinical experts also provided content help, search terms and additional clarification for the AAOS medical librarian. The medical librarian created and executed the search(s). The supporting group of methodologists (AAOS EBM Unit) reviewed all abstracts, recalled pertinent full-text articles for review and evaluated the quality of studies meeting the inclusion criteria. They also abstracted, analyzed, interpreted, and/or summarized the relevant evidence for each recommendation and prepared the initial draft for the final meeting. Upon completion of the systematic reviews, the physician guideline development group participated in a three-day recommendation meeting on May 15-17, 2015. At this meeting, the physician experts and methodologists evaluated and integrated all material to develop the final recommendations. The final recommendations and rationales were edited, written and voted on at the final meeting. The draft guideline recommendations and rationales received final review by the methodologists to ensure that these recommendations and rationales were consistent with the data. The draft was then completed and submitted for peer review on September 8, 2015.</p>
<p>The resulting draft guidelines were then peer-reviewed, edited in response to that review and subsequently sent for public commentary, whereafter additional edits were made. Thereafter, the draft guideline was sequentially approved by the AAOS Committee on Evidence-Based Quality and Value, AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors. All AAOS guidelines are reviewed and updated or retired every five years in accordance with the criteria of the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC).</p>
<p>Thus the process of AAOS guideline development incorporates the benefits from clinical physician expertise as well as the statistical knowledge and interpretation of non-conflicted methodologists. The process also includes an extensive review process offering the opportunity for over 200 clinical physician experts to provide input into the draft prior to publication. This process provides a sound basis for minimizing bias, enhancing transparency and ensuring the highest level of accuracy for interpretation of the evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulating PICO Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline development group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of PICO questions. These questions specify the patient population of interest (P), the intervention of interest (I), the comparisons of interest (C), and the patient-oriented outcomes of interest (O). They function as questions for the systematic review, not as final recommendations or conclusions. Once established, these <em>a priori</em> PICO questions cannot be modified until the final guideline development group meeting.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defining the Strength of the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Judging the strength of evidence is only a stepping stone towards arriving at the strength of a guideline recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes.</p>
<p>Strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation. As such, the strength expresses how possible it is that a recommendation will be overturned by future evidence. It is very difficult for future evidence to overturn a recommendation that is based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect. It is much more likely that future evidence will overturn recommendations derived from a few small case series. Consequently, recommendations based on the former kind of evidence are given a high strength of recommendation and recommendations based on the latter kind of evidence are given a low strength.</p>
<p>To develop the strength of a recommendation, AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength for each recommendation that took only the final strength of evidence (including quality and applicability) and the quantity of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wording of the Final Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>To prevent bias in the way recommendations are worded, the AAOS uses specific predetermined language stems that are governed by the evidence strengths. Each recommendation was written using language that accounts for the final strength of the recommendation.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Following the final meeting, the guideline draft undergoes peer review for additional input from external content experts. Written comments are provided on the structured review form (see Appendix VII in the original guideline document). All peer reviewers are required to disclose their conflicts of interest. To guide who participates, the guideline development group identifies specialty societies at the introductory meeting. <em>Organizations</em>, not <em>individuals</em>, are specified.</p>
<p>The specialty societies are solicited for nominations of individual peer reviewers approximately six weeks before the final meeting. The peer review period is announced as it approaches and others interested are able to volunteer to review the draft. The chair of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Committee on Evidence Based Quality and Value reviews the draft of the guideline prior to dissemination.</p>
<p>Some specialty societies (both orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic) ask their evidence-based practice (EBP) committee to provide review of the guideline. The organization is responsible for coordinating the distribution of materials and consolidating their comments onto one form. The chair of the external EBP committees provides disclosure of their conflicts of interest (COI) and manages the potential conflicts of their members.</p>
<p>Again, the AAOS asks for comments to be assembled into a single response form by the specialty society and for the individual submitting the review to provide disclosure of potentially conflicting interests. The peer review stage gives external stakeholders an opportunity to provide evidence-based direction for modifications that they believe have been overlooked. Since the draft is subject to revisions until its approval by the AAOS Board of Directors as the final step in the guideline development process, confidentiality of all working drafts is essential.</p>
<p>The manager of the evidence-based medicine unit drafts the initial responses to comments that address methodology. These responses are then reviewed by the guideline development group chair and vice-chair, who respond to questions concerning clinical practice and techniques. The director of the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs provides input as well. All comments received and the initial drafts of the responses are also reviewed by all members of the guideline development group. All changes to a recommendation as a result of peer review are based on the evidence and undergoes majority vote by the guideline development group members via teleconference. Final revisions are summarized in a detailed report that is made part of the guideline document throughout the remainder of the review and approval processes.</p>
<p>The AAOS believes in the importance of demonstrating responsiveness to input received during the peer review process and welcomes the critiques of external specialty societies. Following final approval of the guideline, all individual responses are posted on the <a href="/web/20180712205733/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50092&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aaos.org%2fguidelines" title="AAOS Web site">AAOS Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712205733im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> with a point-by-point reply to each non-editorial comment. Reviewers who wish to remain anonymous notify the AAOS to have their names de-identified; their comments, the authors'&nbsp;responses, and their COI disclosures are still posted.</p>
<p>Review of the Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome guideline was requested of 18 organizations. Seven returned comments on the structured review form (see Appendix IX in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Commentary</span></strong></p>
<p>After modifying the draft in response to peer review, the guideline was subjected to a thirty day period of "Public Commentary." Commentators consist of members of the AAOS, members of the Council on Research and Quality, members of the Board of Councilors, and members of the Board of Specialty Societies. The guideline is automatically forwarded to the AAOS Board of Directors and Council on Research and Quality so that they may review it and provide comment prior to being asked to approve the document. Members of the Board of Councilors and Board of Specialty Societies are solicited for interest. If they request to see the document, it is forwarded to them for comment. Based on these bodies, over 200 commentators have the opportunity to provide input into this guideline. Three members returned public comments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The AAOS Guideline Approval Process</span></strong></p>
<p>This final guideline draft must be approved by the AAOS Committee on Evidence Based Quality and Value Committee, the AAOS Council on Research and Quality, and the AAOS Board of Directors. These decision-making bodies are described in Appendix II in the original guideline document and are not designated to modify the contents. Their charge is to approve or reject its publication by majority vote.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The main benefit of a guideline focused on diagnosis is the emphasis on standardized diagnostic criteria which reduce variability in the case definition for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). This could have an important impact on the care of CTS, by minimizing the risk of incorrect diagnosis, and also help in the design of studies seeking to identify associations with specific workplace exposures, an area of interest for workers.</p>
<p>The benefits of treatment recommendations include decreased variability of care, relief of pain, and improvement in function.</p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for benefits of specific interventions.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The user should be aware of the limitations and specific utility of hand-held nerve conduction study (NCS) devices. They should not be used in patients that have symptoms or signs that might suggest an alternative diagnosis or in patients who have weakness or atrophy. Use of the hand-held NCS device in those with alternative diagnosis to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) or motor deficit may result in missed or delayed diagnosis. </li>
    <li>While diagnostic scales/questionnaires can be used for the clinical assessment of CTS, they may be unable to exclude other etiologies that could mimic CTS (such as cervical radiculopathy), or identify other disorders (such as polyneuropathy) that may affect the decision making process regarding therapy. Where indicated, appropriate clinical evaluation for alternative diagnoses should be carried out. Electrodiagnostic testing may be of most value when the clinical diagnosis is unclear or when atypical features exist. </li>
    <li>There is potential harm of corticosteroid injection in the vicinity of flexor tendons and neurovascular structures. </li>
    <li>The risks associated with surgical release are those of a small outpatient operative procedure. </li>
    <li>The main concern with the local infiltration of anesthetic agents is the well-documented cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine. </li>
    <li>There is a potential risk of bleeding in patients who undergo surgical procedures while on anticoagulants. </li>
    <li>Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not without consequence. Financial cost, anaphylaxis, development of antibiotic resistance, and changes in microbiome population are all factors. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline was developed by an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) physician volunteer guideline development group based on a systematic review of the current scientific and clinical information and accepted approaches to treatment and/or diagnosis. This Clinical Practice Guideline is not intended to be a fixed protocol, as some patients may require more or less treatment or different means of diagnosis. Clinical patients may not necessarily be the same as those found in a clinical trial. Patient care and treatment should always be based on a clinician's independent medical judgment, given the individual patient's clinical circumstances. </li>
    <li>This summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone. Treatment decisions should be made in light of all circumstances presented by the patient. Treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient rely on mutual communication between patient, physician, and other healthcare practitioners. </li>
    <li>Some drugs or medical devices referenced or described in this Clinical Practice Guideline may not have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or may have been cleared for a specific use only. The FDA has stated that it is the responsibility of the physician to determine the FDA clearance status of each drug or device he or she wishes to use in clinical practice. </li>
    <li>Musculoskeletal care is provided in many different settings by many different providers. The authors created this guideline as an educational tool to guide qualified physicians through a series of treatment decisions in an effort to improve the quality and efficiency of care. This guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment must be made in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution. </li>
