<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary of Literature Review</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Other than skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Since the advent of screening mammography in the United States, breast cancer mortality has decreased 36% between 1989 and 2012, after slowly increasing before that time. Long-term follow-up analysis of populations before and after the institution of screening mammography attributes the decrease in mortality to screening of the general population. In addition to mortality reduction, early detection allows for a wider range of less invasive treatment options. </p>
<p>The sensitivity of mammography is dependent upon breast density, where sensitivity decreases with the increase of breast density. Breast density is reported on mammography as: A = "almost entirely fatty," B = "scattered areas of fibroglandular density," C = "heterogeneously dense," or D = "extremely dense," where "heterogeneously dense" and "extremely dense" (C and D categories) are considered dense. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Procedures by Variant</strong></p>
<p><em>Variant 1: Breast Cancer Screening. Average-risk Women: Women with &lt;15% Lifetime Risk of Breast Cancer</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mammography and DBT</span></p>
<p>In follow-up of randomized controlled trials of screening mammography in women 40 to 74 years of age, there continues to be a highly significant decrease in mortality in those randomized to invitation to screening mammography. Because breast cancer incidence increases with age, more women among the younger age group (40-50) will need to be screened for each life saved than for women 50 years of age or older. However, because younger women have a longer life expectancy, life years gained for the women diagnosed with breast cancer by screening in their 40s is higher than in the 50- to 70-year-old population. The age at which various organizations recommend beginning screening mammography and the frequency at which mammography is recommended in different age groups varies based upon the weight given to the perceived risks (false-positive examinations and the possibility of over-diagnosis) and benefits of screening (mortality reduction and less invasive treatment options). Some groups recommend screening for all women starting at age 50, with screening recommended between 40 to 50 years of age dependent upon patient preference or risk. However, personalized screening in the 40 to 49 year age group would cause the majority of screen-detected cancers to be excluded from detection. Groups also vary on whether screening mammography is recommended as an annual or biennial examination. Based on a review of the randomized trials and subsequent meta-analyses, the ACR recommends annual screening beginning at 40 years of age. There is no upper age limit established for screening mammography, but as the benefits of screening mammography may take years to be fully realized, screening recommendations should take into account life expectancy and comorbid conditions, with screening mammography remaining appropriate when a woman's life expectancy exceeds 5 to 7 years.</p>
<p>Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) can address some of the limitations encountered with standard mammographic views. In addition to planar images, DBT allows for creation and viewing of thin-section reconstructed images that may decrease the lesion-masking effect of overlapping normal tissue and reveal the true nature of potential false-positive findings without the need for recall. Several studies confirm that in a screening setting, the cancer detection rate is increased with use of DBT compared with 2-D mammography alone. Additionally, the rate of recall for benign findings (false-positives) can be decreased. Some authors found these advantages to be especially pronounced in women under age 50, in those with dense breasts, and with lesion types including spiculated masses and asymmetries. Interpretation time for DBT images is greater than for standard mammography. Additionally, dose is increased if standard 2-D images are obtained in addition to DBT images. However, synthesized reconstructed images (a virtual planar image created from the tomographic dataset) may replace the need for a 2-D correlative view; current data suggest that these synthetic images perform as well as standard full-field digital images. DBT is almost always performed as part of an examination that also includes digital mammography. The digital mammography part of the examination may be in the form of traditional projection mammography or synthesized image from the DBT data. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span></p>
<p>The presence of dense breast tissue lowers the sensitivity of mammography and increases breast cancer risk when compared with patients with fatty breasts. Adding hand-held or automated breast ultrasound (US) to mammography in women with dense breasts increases the cancer detection rate but also substantially increases the false-positive rate. In the initial clinical experience with screening breast US after a dense breast notification law was enacted on a state-wide level, the cancer detection rate increased but the number of short interval follow-up recommendations increased substantially and the positive predictive value of a biopsy recommendation was much lower. For women with dense breasts tissue but no additional risk factors, US may be useful as an adjunct to mammography for incremental cancer detection, but the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination should be considered in the decision. There are no data to support the use of US for average-risk women with nondense breasts. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MBI and FDG-PEM</span></p>
<p>Supplementing mammography with molecular breast imaging (MBI) in women with dense breasts increases the cancer detection rate. However, there have been no large population studies of MBI for screening, and the whole-body radiation dose with this technique is concerning. Positron emission mammography with fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PEM) is similarly limited by radiation dose and lack of evidence in large screening populations. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MRI</span></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for screening women of average risk. </p>
<p><em>Variant 2: Breast Cancer Screening. Intermediate-risk Women: Women with Personal History of Breast Cancer, Lobular Neoplasia, Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia, or 15% to 20% Lifetime Risk of Breast Cancer</em></p>
<p>Some women with an intermediate risk of breast cancer may benefit by beginning screening mammography earlier than 40 years of age and may also benefit from supplemental screening. The recommendations for supplemental screening for women at intermediate risk of breast cancer, including those with a personal history of breast cancer, a history of lobular carcinoma in situ or ADH, those with an intermediate family history and a lifetime risk of 15% to 20%, or women with dense breasts continues to be an area of debate. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mammography and DBT</span></p>
<p>Annual screening mammography is recommended for women with biopsy-proven lobular neoplasia or atypical ductal hyperplasia beginning at diagnosis, but not when &lt;30 years of age. Women who have a prior history of breast cancer are recommended to have mammography every 12 months (and 6 to 12 months post-radiation if the breast is conserved). </p>
<p>The sensitivity of mammography is dependent upon breast density, with sensitivity decreasing with increasing breast density. DBT can address some of the limitations encountered with standard mammographic views. In addition to planar images, DBT allows for creation and viewing of thin-section reconstructed images that can decrease the lesion-masking effect of overlapping normal tissue and reveal the true nature of potential false-positive findings without the need for recall. Several studies confirm that in a screening setting, cancer detection rate is increased with the use of DBT compared to 2-D mammography alone. Additionally, the rate of recall for benign findings (false-positives) can be decreased. Some authors found these advantages to be especially pronounced in women under age 50, in those with dense breasts, and with lesion types including spiculated masses and asymmetries. Interpretation time for DBT images is greater than for standard mammography. Additionally, dose is increased if standard 2-D images are obtained in addition to DBT images. However, synthesized reconstructed images (a virtual planar image created from the tomographic dataset) may replace the need for a 2-D correlative view; current data suggest that these synthetic images perform as well as standard full-field digital images. DBT is almost always performed as part of an examination that also includes digital mammography. The digital mammography part of the examination may be in the form of traditional projection mammography or synthesized from the DBT data. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span></p>
<p>In women with dense breasts and increased risk of breast cancer, mammography sensitivity can be as low as 50%; supplementing mammography screening with US will significantly increase cancer detection, although false-positive rates are also substantially increased. In intermediate-risk women with dense breasts, supplemental US screening is an option. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MRI</span></p>
<p>The American Cancer Society considers there to be insufficient evidence for or against MRI as an adjunct to mammography in women at intermediate risk of breast cancer. However, recent studies support the use of screening MRI in certain subsets of this population, including women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ or a personal history of breast cancer. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MBI and FDG-PEM</span></p>
<p>Supplementing mammography with MBI in women with dense breasts increases the cancer detection rate. However, there have been no large population studies of MBI for screening and whole body radiation dose with this technique is concerning. FDG-PEM is similarly limited by radiation dose and lack of evidence in large screening populations. </p>
<p><em>Variant 3: Breast Cancer Screening. High-risk Women: Women with a BRCA Gene Mutation and Their Untested First-degree Relatives, Women with a History of Chest Irradiation Between 10 to 30 Years of Age, Women with 20% or Greater Lifetime Risk of Breast Cancer</em></p>
<p>Women at high risk for breast cancer include those with BRCA or other known genetic predispositions, women with a very strong family history placing them at more than a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, and those with prior mantle radiation therapy between 10 to 30 years of age. In addition to beginning screening mammography earlier than the general population, women in this high-risk group benefit from supplemental screening. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mammography and DBT</span> </p>
<p>Annual mammography is recommended starting 8 years after radiation therapy but not before age 25 for women who received mantle radiation between 10 to 30 years of age. As there is some concern about young women with an inherited cancer predisposition having increased sensitivity to radiation, women with a genetic predisposition are recommended for annual screening beginning 10 years earlier than the affected relative at the time of diagnosis but not before age 30. </p>
<p>The sensitivity of mammography is dependent upon breast density, with sensitivity decreasing with increasing breast density. DBT can address some of the limitations encountered with standard mammographic views. In addition to planar images, DBT allows for creation and viewing of thin-section reconstructed images that may decrease the lesion-masking effect of overlapping normal tissue and reveal the true nature of potential false-positive findings without the need for recall. Several studies confirm that in a screening setting, the cancer detection rate is increased with use of DBT compared to 2-D mammography alone. Additionally, the rate of recall for benign findings (false-positives) can be decreased. Some authors found these advantages to be especially pronounced in women under age 50, in those with dense breasts, and those with lesion types including spiculated masses and asymmetries. Interpretation time for DBT images is greater than for standard mammography. Additionally, dose is increased if standard 2-D images are obtained in addition to DBT images. However, synthesized reconstructed images (a virtual planar image created from the tomographic dataset) may replace the need for a 2-D correlative view; and current data suggest that these synthetic images perform as well as standard full-field digital images. DBT is almost always performed as part of an examination that also includes digital mammography. The digital mammography part of the examination may be in the form of traditional projection mammography or synthesized image from the DBT data. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MRI</span> </p>
<p>Breast MRI in high-risk women has a higher sensitivity than mammography, and the combination of mammography and MRI in this population has the highest sensitivity. In a high-risk population, MRI and mammography combined have a higher sensitivity (92.7%) than US and mammography combined (52%). Therefore, in high-risk women for whom supplemental screening is indicated, MRI is recommended when possible. Screening MRI is recommended in women with BRCA gene mutations and their untested first-degree relatives as well as women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of ~20% or greater. Also included in this high-risk group are women who have received radiation therapy to the chest between 10 to 30 years of age as well as women with other genetic syndromes that increase the risk of breast cancer. </p>
<p>Screening high-risk women with breast MRI is cost-effective, and the cost-effectiveness of screening MRI increases with increasing breast cancer risk. The American Cancer Society recommends breast-screening MRI in high-risk women, and the ACR and the Society of Breast Imaging endorse those recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">US</span> </p>
<p>Screening US is indicated in high-risk patients who cannot tolerate MRI. Mammography alone does not perform as well as mammography plus supplemental screening in high-risk women, especially those with a genetic predisposition, and supplemental screening US is indicated in high-risk patients who cannot tolerate MRI. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MBI and FDG-PEM</span> </p>
<p>Supplementing mammography with MBI in women with dense breasts increases the cancer detection rate. However, there have been no large population studies of MBI for screening and the whole-body radiation dose with this technique is concerning. FDG-PEM is similarly limited by radiation dose and lack of evidence in large screening populations. </p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For average-risk women, annual screening mammography or DBT (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2-D images) is recommended beginning at age 40. For women with dense breasts, US may also be considered, but the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination should be considered in the decision. </li>
    <li>For intermediate-risk women, breast mammography or DBT (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2-D images) is recommended. MRI may be considered as an adjunct to mammography or DBT (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2-D images) depending upon risk factors. For women with dense breasts, US may be an option, but the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination should be considered in the decision. </li>
    <li>For high-risk women, mammography or DBT (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2-D images) is recommended. MRI is recommended as an adjunct to screening mammography or DBT (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2-D images). US is recommended when the patient cannot tolerate MRI. </li>

<p>A new literature search was conducted in December 2015 and updated on March 2016 to identify additional evidence published since the <em>ACR Appropriateness Criteria&reg; Breast Cancer Screening</em> topic was finalized. Using the search strategy described in the literature search companion (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), 379 articles were found. Twenty-four articles were added to the bibliography. The remaining articles were not used due to either poor study design, the articles were not relevant or generalizable to the topic, the results were unclear, misinterpreted, or biased, or the articles were already cited in the original bibliography. </p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the rating rounds is to systematically and transparently determine the panels' recommendations while mitigating any undue influence of one or more panel members on another individual panel members' interpretation of the evidence. The panel member's rating is determined by reviewing the evidence presented in the Summary of Literature Review and assessing the risks or harms of performing the procedure or treatment balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure or treatment. The individual panel member ratings are used to calculate the median rating, which determines the panel's rating. The assessment of the amount of deviation of individual ratings from the panel rating determines whether there is disagreement among the panel about the rating. </p>
<p>The process used in the rating rounds is a modified Delphi method based on the methodology described in the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual. </p>
<p>The appropriateness is rated on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Determining the Panel's Recommendation</span></strong> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ratings represent an individual's assessment of the risks and benefits of performing a specific procedure for a specific clinical scenario on an ordinal scale. The recommendation is the appropriateness category (i.e., "Usually appropriate," "May be appropriate," or "Usually not appropriate"). </li>
    <li>The appropriateness category for a procedure and clinical scenario is determined by the panel's median rating without disagreement (see below for definition of disagreement). The panel's median rating is calculated after each rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the rating category is "May be appropriate (Disagreement)" with a rating of "5" so users understand the group disagreed on the final recommendation. The actual panel median rating is documented to provide additional context. </li>
    <li>Disagreement is defined as excessive dispersion of the individual ratings from the group (in this case, an Appropriateness Criteria [AC] panel) median as determined by comparison of the interpercentile range (IPR) and the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry (IPRAS). In those instances when the IPR is greater than the IPRAS, there is disagreement. For a complete discussion, please refer to chapter 8 of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual. </li>
    <li>Once the final recommendations have been determined, the panel reviews the document. If two thirds of the panel feel a final recommendation is wrong (e.g., does not accurately reflect the evidence, may negatively impact patient health, has unintended consequences that may harm health care, etc.) and the process must be started again from the beginning. </li>
</ul>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The age at which various organizations recommend beginning screening mammography and the frequency at which mammography is recommended in different age groups varies based upon the weight given to the perceived risks (false-positive examinations and the possibility of over-diagnosis) and benefits of screening (mortality reduction and less invasive treatment options). </li>
    <li>Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) can address some of the limitations encountered with standard mammographic views. In addition to planar images, DBT allows for creation and viewing of thin-section reconstructed images that may decrease the lesion-masking effect of overlapping normal tissue and reveal the true nature of potential false-positive findings without the need for recall. Several studies confirm that in a screening setting, cancer detection rate is increased with use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to two-dimensional (2-D) mammography alone. Additionally, the rate of recall for benign findings (false positives) can be decreased. Some authors found these advantages to be especially pronounced in women under age 50, in those with dense breasts, and with lesion types including spiculated masses and asymmetries. </li>
    <li>Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in high-risk women has a higher sensitivity than mammography, and the combination of mammography and MRI in this population has the highest sensitivity. In a high-risk population, MRI and mammography combined have a higher sensitivity (92.7%) than ultrasound (US) and mammography combined (52%). Screening high-risk women with breast MRI is cost-effective and the cost-effectiveness of screening MRI increases with increasing breast cancer risk. </li>
</ul></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The age at which various organizations recommend beginning screening mammography and the frequency at which mammography is recommended in different age groups varies based upon the weight given to the perceived risks (false-positive examinations and the possibility of over-diagnosis) and benefits of screening (mortality reduction and less invasive treatment options). </li>
    <li>The presence of dense breast tissue lowers the sensitivity of mammography and increases breast cancer risk when compared with patients with fatty breasts. Adding hand-held or automated breast ultrasound (US) to mammography in women with dense breasts increases the cancer detection rate but also substantially increases the false-positive rate. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relative Radiation Level Information</span></strong></p>
<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria&reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. </li>
    <li>ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply society endorsement of the final document. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclosing Potential Conflicts of Interest and Management of Conflicts of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>An important aspect of committee operations is the disclosure and management of potential conflicts of interest. In 2016, the American College of Radiology (ACR) began an organization-wide review of its conflict of interest (COI) policies. The current ACR COI policy is available on its <a href="/web/20180712195249/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51253&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.acr.org%2f-%2fmedia%2fACR%2fFiles%2fMember-Resources%2fVolunteer%2fConflict-of-Interest-Policy.pdf%2fla%2fen" title="ACR Web site">Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712195249im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The Appropriateness Criteria (AC) program's COI process varies from the organization's current policy to accommodate the requirements for qualified provider-led entities as designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) program. </p>
<p>When physicians become participants in the AC program, welcome letters are sent to inform them of their panel roles and responsibilities, including a link to complete the <a href="/web/20180712195249/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51253&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.acr.org%2f-%2fmedia%2fACR%2fFiles%2fAppropriateness-Criteria%2fACCOI-form.pdf%2fla%2fen" title="ACR Web site">COI form</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712195249im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The COI form requires disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest. ACR staff oversees the COI evaluation process, coordinating with review panels consisting of ACR staff and members, who determine when there is a conflict of interest and what action, if any, is appropriate. In addition to making the information publicly available, management may include exclusion from some topic processes, exclusion from a topic, or exclusion from the panel. </p>
<p>Besides potential COI disclosure, AC staff begins every committee call with the conflict of interest disclosure statement listed below reminding members to update their COI forms. If any updates to their COI information have not been submitted, they are instructed not to participate in discussion where an undisclosed conflict may exist. </p>
<p>Finally, all ACR AC are published as part of the Journal of the American College of Radiology (JACR) electronic supplement. Those who participated on the document and are listed as authors must complete the JACR process that includes completing the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) COI form which is reviewed by the journal's staff/publisher. </p>
<p>Dr. Slanetz reports author or co-author on three active topics (breast MRI and emerging technologies; breast cancer screening; and imaging of dense breasts. Royalties based on usage by membership, approximately $1500 per year. The other authors have no conflicts of interest related to the material discussed in this article.</p></div></p>
