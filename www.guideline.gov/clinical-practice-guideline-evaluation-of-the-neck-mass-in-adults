<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. </p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid routine treatment with antibiotics, which may be inappropriate or ineffective treatment for a neck mass, thus leading to delayed diagnosis of malignancy or other serious illness. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective treatment, affordable quality care) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefits: Avoid delay in diagnosis of malignancy, promote judicious antibiotic therapy, limit bacterial resistance, reduce antibiotic adverse effects, reduced cost </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Under treatment of a missed bacterial infection </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perception by the guideline development group (GDG) that antibiotics are common for noninfectious neck masses, delaying diagnosis and/or referral. Further perception that physical examination is the primary determinant of an infectious cause of a neck mass, and history is a secondary determinant. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>

    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Statement 2a. Stand-Alone Suspicious History</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for &ge;2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. </p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. </p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To use simple questions to identify patients at increased risk for malignancy based on specific historical features. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective prevention/treatment) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with an earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for high-risk patients, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, provide psychological benefit through timely evaluation, facilitate further care </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The risk of missing or delaying diagnosis of a malignancy in a patient who is at increased risk is more important than false-positive clinical diagnosis in a patient with nonmalignant disease. Assumption by the GDG that early identification of patients at increased risk with focused questions can improve outcomes, despite any direct clinical evidence to substantiate this assumption. </li>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Statement 2b. Stand-Alone Suspicious Physical Examination</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on &ge;1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size &gt;1.5 cm, and/or ulceration of overlying skin. </p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. </p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To identify patients at increased risk for malignancy because of specific features on physical examination. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective prevention/treatment) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for patients at increased risk, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, psychological benefit of timely evaluation, facilitate further care </li>

    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: GDG debated whether firm consistency of the mass is a predictor of malignancy (majority opinion: 14 of 18 felt that firmness is predictive of malignancy); GDG also debated whether absolute size of the mass, regardless of neck location, is a predictor of malignancy. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Statement 2c. Additional Suspicious Signs and Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for all adults with a neck mass to identify those patients with an increased risk for malignancy. </p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. </p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: This statement moves beyond the previously noted stand-alone suspicious findings (lack of infectious etiology, &ge;2-week duration of the mass, reduced mobility, firm texture, size &gt;1.5 cm, ulceration) by using the initial history and examination to identify patients who have signs and symptoms that place them at increased risk of malignancy. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective prevention/treatments) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on case series </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for increased-risk patients, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, psychological benefit of timely evaluation, facilitate further care </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>

<p>The recommendations in this clinical practice guideline are based on systematic reviews identified by a professional information specialist using an explicit search strategy. Additional background evidence included randomized controlled trials and observational studies, as needed, to supplement the systematic reviews or to fill gaps when a review was not available. An information specialist conducted 2 systematic literature searches from December 2015 through February 2016 using a validated filter strategy to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and comparative studies. For a complete list of search terms, refer to the original guideline document. </p>
<p>The English-language searches were performed in multiple databases, including PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) UK, and Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase (Canada). In certain instances, targeted searches for lower-level evidence were performed to address gaps from the systematic searches identified in writing the guideline from April 2016 through November 2016. January 1980 was the beginning date for all of the searches.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm as outlined in the third edition of the American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guideline development manual. The guideline development group (GDG) consisted of 21 panel members representing experts in advanced practice nursing, clinical pathology, consumer advocacy, emergency medicine, general practice medicine, general surgery, head and neck surgery and oncology, otolaryngology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, physician assistants, and radiology.</p>
<p>In a series of conference calls, the GDG defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 12 months devoted to guideline development ending in August 2016, the GDG met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, with use of decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) to facilitate the creation of actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft were used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). </p>
<p>The AAO-HNSF staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in September 2016 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating neck masses. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible clinician, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent practice variation is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline development group (GDG) sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>

Existing brochures and publication by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations. As a supplement to clinicians, an algorithm of the guideline's action statements has been provided (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The algorithm allows for a more rapid understanding of the guideline's logic and the sequence of the action statements. The guideline development group (GDG) hopes that the algorithm can be adopted as a quick reference guide to support the implementation of the guideline's recommendations.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest</strong></span></p>
<p>Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.</p>
