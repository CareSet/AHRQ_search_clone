The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG), University of Liverpool (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Critique of the Methods of Review(s)</strong></p>
<p><em>Searches</em></p>
<p>The company's submission (CS) adequately describes the search strategies used to identify relevant studies relating to the use of pembrolizumab for metastatic melanoma, the searches were not specific to treatment after ipilimumab or ipilimumab na&iuml;ve melanoma. The company conducted two systematic searches for the clinical evidence: (1) a search for direct evidence and (2) a search for indirect evidence and adverse reactions. Full details of the strategies used to derive clinical evidence were reported in the CS (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The ERG's brief description and critique of the searches is reported in Appendix 1 of the ERG report. In summary, the ERG concluded that searching was carried out to an adequate standard and accurately reflected the population and indication. The ERG is confident that the company did not miss any relevant references.</p>
<p><em>Eligibility Criteria</em></p>
<p>Appropriately, the citations identified were independently assessed for inclusion through two stages by two reviewers using the criteria shown in the table below. First, the reviewers independently scanned all abstracts and proceedings. Second, full text articles were then obtained and the same two reviewers independently reviewed these. Disagreements about whether to include a study or not were resolved by reaching consensus with the help of a third reviewer.</p>

<p class="Note">*This intervention may be assessed in either ipilimumab-na&iuml;ve or ipilimumab experienced populations.</p>
<p class="Note">BSC, best supportive care; ORR, overall response rate; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression-free survival; RCT, randomised controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>Identified Studies</strong></p>
<p>Four studies were identified by the company: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (KEYNOTE-002, supportive KEYNOTE-001 [Part B2] and KEYNOTE-006) and the non-random KEYNOTE-001 (Part B1) study. The company states: "The second interim-analysis (IA2) of KEYNOTE-002 &hellip; provides the main evidence base for this submission." The ERG agrees that this is the only study that is directly relevant to the decision problem. The ERG provides an assessment of each study's relevance to the decision problem in Table 4 of the ERG report.</p>

<p><strong>The Company's Review of Cost Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Objective of Cost-effectiveness Review</em></p>
<p>The company undertook a search to identify studies reporting the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab, compared with other therapies, for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma who have progressed following treatment with ipilimumab. Details of the search strategies employed by the company are included in the CS. The databases and the initial time horizon for each search are summarised below. In all cases the searches were updated in March 2015.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG), University of Liverpool (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Critique of the Methods of Review(s)</strong></p>
<p><em>Risk of Bias</em></p>
<p>A descriptive critical appraisal of KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-001 was conducted by the company. The company conducted the assessment using the criteria recommended by NICE for company's submissions.</p>
<p><em>Evidence Synthesis</em></p>
<p>Since only one study (KEYNOTE-002) directly compared pembrolizumab with an appropriate comparator (chemotherapy), findings were appropriately presented in a narrative. No indirect treatment comparison or mixed treatment comparison was carried out to compare pembrolizumab to other specified comparators by the company. Given patients with B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation-positive melanoma had already been pre-treated with BRAF inhibitors in the KEYNOTE-002 trial, both the company and the ERG considered that an indirect comparison of pembrolizumab with BRAF inhibitors would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>Since the company's literature search did not identify any studies comparing pembrolizumab to best supportive care (BSC), an indirect comparison of pembrolizumab to BSC may have been considered appropriate. However, the company's literature search did not identify any studies comparing chemotherapy to BSC in patients previously treated with ipilimumab. Therefore, the company stated it was not possible to conduct an indirect comparison in order to obtain an estimate of the efficacy of pembrolizumab relative to BSC in this patient population. The ERG concurs with the company.</p>
<p>The company did consider conducting a meta-analysis comparing pembrolizumab 2 kg/mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W. However from examining the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes in the two relevant trials (KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-001), the company concluded that the two trials were heterogeneous; the company attributed this heterogeneity to differences in the patient characteristics across the two trials (see Section 4.2 of the ERG report). Had it been possible to conduct such a meta-analysis, the results may have been informative in order to support the decision to focus on the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose of pembrolizumab. However, the ERG agrees with the company that a meta-analysis was inappropriate due to the patient populations being too dissimilar.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 4 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional information on clinical effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Economic Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Description of Company's Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The company has developed a de novo economic model to allow the comparison of two treatment regimens, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and chemotherapy/BSC. A schematic of the company's submitted economic model is provided in the company's submission (CS) and is reproduced in Figure 3 of the ERG report. It is a partitioned survival model which comprises three mutually exclusive health states: pre-progression (PFS), post-progression and death. All patients enter the model in the pre-progression state. At the beginning of each time period patients can either remain in the same health state or progress to a worse health state, i.e., patients in the pre-progression state can move to either the post-progression health state or death health state, whilst patients in the post-progression state can only move to the death health state. Estimates of OS and PFS are based on survival data from the KEYNOTE-002 clinical trial. The proportion of patients in the post-progression state is estimated as the difference between OS and PFS.</p>
<p>Patients receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W or chemotherapy/BSC until progression. The chemotherapy/BSC arm is modelled based on chemotherapy of investigators' choice as observed in the KEYNOTE-002 clinical trial. Treatment switches to subsequent therapies are not modelled. The pre-progression and post-progression health states are associated with specific treatment, resource utilisation and adverse event (AE) costs. Time-to-death sub-states are used to capture patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as a function of length of time until death (&lt;30 days, 30 to 89 days, 90 to 179 days and &ge;180 days to death).</p>
<p>The model has been developed in Microsoft Excel and employs a cycle length of 1 week (no half-cycle correction). The time horizon is 30 years and health effects are measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The perspective is that of the National Health Service (NHS) and cost and outcomes are discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%.</p>
<p>Refer to Sections 5 and 6 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for more information on the economic evaluation.</p></div></p>

                    <p>Expert Consensus</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology Appraisal Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the Appraisal Consultation Document (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the Final Appraisal Determination (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</span></strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Cost Analysis</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered that the company's model, which compared pembrolizumab with best supportive care in people with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma after progression with ipilimumab and, for B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) V600 mutation-positive disease, a BRAF or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, had a 3-state model structure that was appropriate for decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was concerned that the progression-free survival (PFS) results were immature and that it was uncertain how many and for how long people would have progression-free disease. However, it accepted that the company's approach to extrapolating PFS using a Gompertz distribution led to PFS results that appeared too optimistic because it was unlikely that people would have life-long progression-free disease.</p>
<p>The Committee expressed the view that the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) approach to modelling overall survival (OS) was generally more clinically plausible than the company's model using 3 separate sources.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The company got the utility values from European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire data from KEYNOTE-002. The utility values were incorporated into the model based on time to death.</p>
<p>The Committee could not identify any specific health-related benefit that had not been already captured in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>None</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee understood that the variables with the biggest impact on the results were the parameters used to extrapolate PFS and the hazard ratio for OS from the 2-stage adjustment method used to extrapolate the OS results.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for pembrolizumab compared with best supportive care was likely to be less than &pound;50,000 per QALY gained.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The evidence from KEYNOTE-002, although immature, suggested that pembrolizumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with conventional chemotherapy and that, when using the 2-stage adjustment method, pembrolizumab was associated with an overall survival (OS)&nbsp;benefit of 3.5 months compared with chemotherapy.</li>
    <li>The Committee concluded that the availability of a new treatment which slows disease progression and improves quality of life when other therapies have failed is very important to patients and their families. </li>
    <li>Pembrolizumab is innovative because it meets a high unmet medical need and because of its low toxicity and favourable adverse effects profile compared with other treatments for metastatic melanoma. </li>

    <li>This guidance represents the views of the National Institute for
    Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and was arrived at after careful
    consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are
    expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical
    judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual
    responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate
    to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
    the patient and/or guardian or carer. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local
    commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded
    that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
    local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need
    to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity

Because pembrolizumab was made available in the NHS through the early access to medicines scheme, NHS England has indicated that this guidance will be implemented 30 days after final publication. </li>
    <li>The Welsh Assembly Minister for Health and Social Services has issued directions to the NHS in Wales on implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 3 months of the guidance being published. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraphs above. This means that, if a patient has unresectable or metastatic melanoma after progression with ipilimumab and, for B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) V600 mutation-positive disease, a BRAF or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that pembrolizumab is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>The Department of Health and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme have agreed that pembrolizumab will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme which makes it available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the company to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. Any enquiries from NHS organisations about the patient access scheme should be directed to Keiron Hughes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180712203113/mailto:keiron.hughes@merck.com">keiron.hughes@merck.com</a>). </li>
