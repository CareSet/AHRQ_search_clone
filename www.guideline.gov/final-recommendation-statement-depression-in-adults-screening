                        <h3><a href="#">Major Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the Levels of Certainty regarding Net Benefit (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendations and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for depression in the general adult population, including pregnant and postpartum women. Screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up. (<strong>B recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). It does not apply to children and adolescents, who are addressed in a separate USPSTF recommendation statement (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the USPSTF guideline <a href="/web/20180713024138/https://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=50073" title="Guideline #10911" target="_blank">Screening for depression in children and adolescents: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening in all adults regardless of risk factors. However, a number of factors are associated with an increased risk of depression. Among general adult populations, prevalence rates vary by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, geographic location, and employment status. Women, young and middle-aged adults, and nonwhite persons have higher rates of depression than their counterparts, as do persons who are undereducated, previously married, or unemployed. Other groups who are at increased risk of developing depression include persons with chronic illnesses (e.g., cancer or cardiovascular disease), other mental health disorders (including substance misuse), or a family history of psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Among older adults, risk factors for depression include disability and poor health status related to medical illness, complicated grief, chronic sleep disturbance, loneliness, and a history of depression. However, the presence or absence of risk factors alone cannot distinguish patients with depression from those without depression.</p>
<p>Risk factors for depression during pregnancy and postpartum include poor self-esteem, child-care stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress, decreased social support, single/unpartnered relationship status, history of depression, difficult infant temperament, previous postpartum depression, lower socioeconomic status, and unintended pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>Commonly used depression screening instruments include the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in various forms and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales in adults, the Geriatric Depression Scale in older adults, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in postpartum and pregnant women. All positive screening results should lead to additional assessment that considers severity of depression and comorbid psychological problems (e.g., anxiety, panic attacks, or substance abuse), alternate diagnoses, and medical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Timing and Interval</strong></p>
<p>There is little evidence regarding the optimal timing for screening. The optimum interval for screening for depression is also unknown; more evidence for all populations is needed to identify ideal screening intervals. A pragmatic approach in the absence of data might include screening all adults who have not been screened previously and using clinical judgment in consideration of risk factors, comorbid conditions, and life events to determine if additional screening of high-risk patients is warranted.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Effective treatment of depression in adults generally includes antidepressants or specific psychotherapy approaches (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] or brief psychosocial counseling), alone or in combination. Given the potential harms to the fetus and newborn child from certain pharmacologic agents, clinicians are encouraged to consider CBT or other evidence-based counseling interventions when managing depression in pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>
<p><strong>Other Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force, which makes evidence-based recommendations on preventive services for community populations, recommends collaborative care for the management of depressive disorders as part of a multicomponent, health care system&ndash;level intervention that uses case managers to link primary care providers, patients, and mental health specialists.

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: An evidence synthesis was prepared by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) for use by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators conducted an initial search for existing synthesized literature and guidelines related to depression screening and treatment in MEDLINE/PubMed, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, BMJ Clinical Evidence, the Institute of Medicine, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, PsycINFO, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the Campbell Collaboration, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, the National Health Services' Health Technology Assessment Programme, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination from 2008 through October 3, 2013. The search strategies are listed in Appendix B in the evidence synthesis.</p>
<p>For pregnant and postpartum women, the investigators systematically evaluated all relevant reviews through abstract and full-text review, and identified existing systematic reviews to use as foundational reviews for benefits and harms of screening and treatment, based on the approach outlined by Whitlock and colleagues. They identified three good-quality reviews that served as foundational reviews. The investigators chose these reviews based on relevance (i.e., inclusion and exclusion criteria that were at least as inclusive as their review), having conducted a good-quality search, having reported good-quality article evaluation methods, and recency. For the question of harms of antidepressants (key question 5), the foundational review was of sufficient quality and the evidence base was so extensive that the investigators used this review directly as evidence in their report and did not reevaluate individual studies included in this review. They used the other two foundational reviews as the starting point for study identification for other key questions related to pregnant and postpartum women, and then searched for additional original research published after the search windows of these foundational reviews. The investigators evaluated all studies included in each of these foundational reviews against the a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria. Then they searched for newly published literature bridging from these foundational reviews. For general adult populations, the investigators evaluated all included studies in the previous USPSTF review in addition to searching for newly published literature.</p>
<p>The investigators searched for newly published literature in the following databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through January 20, 2015 (see Appendix B in the evidence synthesis). In general adult populations, they searched from January 1, 2009, bridging from the previous USPSTF review. The investigators began the bridge search for pregnant and postpartum women from January 1, 2012, since there was at least one foundational review with a search period for each key aquestion for pregnant and postpartum women that extended into 2012. They also reviewed reference lists of relevant studies and reviews to identify additional potentially relevant studies that were not identified by the literature searches or foundational reviews. The investigators managed literature search results using the bibliographic management software program Reference Manager &reg;, version 12.0 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed titles and abstracts using an online platform (Abstrackr) against prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Appendix B Tables 1 and 2 in the evidence synthesis). Full-text articles were reviewed by two investigators for a final inclusion/exclusion decision. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or consultation with the other investigators. A list of excluded studies after full-text review, including the reasons for exclusion, is available in Appendix C in the evidence synthesis.</p>
<p>The investigators included fair- and good-quality studies published in the English language that were conducted among adults age 18 years and older living in countries ranked as having "very high" human development according to the World Health Organization (WHO), including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized, controlled clinical trials (CCTs) examining benefits or harms of screening or treatment (psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or collaborative care) in pregnant and postpartum women </li>
    <li>Studies of diagnostic accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) or Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in pregnant and postpartum women </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews, RCTs, CCTs, or large comparative observational studies that examined harms of antidepressants in pregnant or postpartum women </li>
    <li>RCTs and CCTs examining benefits or harms of screening in general or older adult populations </li>
</ul>
<p>The investigators defined postpartum women as those whose babies were younger than age 1 year at study enrollment. They required that studies assessing the benefits and harms of screening for either population be conducted in a primary care setting, including obstetrics/gynecology or pediatrics for postpartum depression screening. Studies limited to persons with other medical or mental health conditions were excluded; however, the investigators did not exclude studies that included some persons with such conditions, as long as it was not a requirement of participation. They did not exclude screening studies that included participants who already had a chart diagnosis of depression or were being treated for depression. Studies of depression screening could also include additional treatment elements, as long as the screening test results were given to the primary care provider. The investigators required that the control group participants either were not screened or did not have their screening test results sent to their provider.</p>
<p>Studies of psychotherapy (examined only for pregnant and postpartum women) could additionally take place in virtual (i.e., online or computer-based) or mental health clinic settings. The investigators required that studies of depression treatment use population-based screening to identify eligible patients. They considered studies to include population-based screening if they attempted to recruit all or a consecutive or random subset of women in a specific setting or population during the study's recruitment window, with individual outreach to potential participants for depression screening as part of determination of study eligibility. Thus, the investigators excluded studies in which recruitment was based on referral, from populations of patients with known or likely depression (e.g., persons identified as having depression in their medical charts), or from volunteers recruited through media or other advertising. Control groups in treatment studies could include usual care, no intervention, waitlist, attention control, or a minimal intervention (e.g., &le;15 minutes of information, not intended to be a therapeutic dose). The investigators excluded comparative effectiveness studies.</p>
<p>The investigators excluded trials exploring the efficacy of complementary and alternative therapies, such as yoga, exercise, transcranial stimulation, and dietary supplements such as St. John's wort, since they are not widely used in primary care settings. They also excluded trials focused on second-line treatments for severe depression when first-line treatments are not effective, such as polypharmacy and electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
<p>The investigators required minimum follow-up of 6 weeks for studies of benefits or screening and treatment, and harms of psychotherapy or collaborative care interventions. They had no minimum follow-up for harms of antidepressants.</p>
<p>For diagnostic accuracy studies (examined only for pregnant and postpartum women), the time between the index and reference tests could not exceed 2 weeks on average. In addition, these studies must have had patients covering a wide spectrum of symptom severity, comparable to what would occur in typical primary care settings, including those without symptoms, those with subclinical symptomatology, and those with diagnostic-level symptomatology (i.e., case-control designs were excluded). A valid reference standard was a structured or semistructured diagnostic interview with a trained interviewer or a nonbrief (&gt;5 minutes) unstructured interview with a mental health clinician. Studies that only gave the reference test to a subset of participants had to make appropriate adjustments to their analysis or provide sufficient data to allow us to adjust the analysis. Studies had to report sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) or negative predictive value (NPV), or the raw data to allow us to calculate diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p>The investigators included a variety of study designs in examination of harms of antidepressants in pregnant and postpartum women. Their primary data source was one of the foundational reviews that included extensive information on harms of antidepressant treatment. The investigators focused on serious maternal or fetal/infant harms. Maternal harms included suicidality, serotonin syndrome, cardiac effects, seizures (bupropion only), bleeding, cardiometabolic effects, and preeclampsia. Infant harms included neonatal death, major malformations, small for gestational age/low birth weight, cardiopulmonary effects, and other serious events requiring medical attention. Comparative cohort studies had to be large (minimum of 10 cases in each exposure group) and include appropriate control group participants who were not taking antidepressants.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The investigators screened 6,536 abstracts and identified 71 included studies that reported results in 91 publications. For pregnant and postpartum women, they included six trials addressing the benefits or harms of screening, 26 diagnostic accuracy studies, and 32 studies that assessed the benefits or harms of treatment. This final group included one recent systematic review on the harms of antidepressants. In general and older adults, the investigators included nine trials that addressed the benefits or harms of screening.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment and Data Abstraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently assessed the quality of included studies using criteria defined by the USPSTF and supplemented it with criteria from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 2 and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for diagnostic accuracy and observational studies, respectively (see Appendix B Table 3 in the evidence synthesis). They also used the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) to assess the quality of the foundational evidence review used for harms of antidepressant treatment in pregnant and postpartum women. Each study was assigned a final quality rating of good, fair, or poor and disagreements were resolved through discussion.</p>
<p>The investigators excluded studies rated as poor quality (i.e., attrition &gt;40%, differential attrition of &gt;20%, other "fatal flaws," or the cumulative effects of multiple minor flaws and/or missing important information significant enough to limit the confidence in the validity of the results). Good-quality studies included all or most of the following: adequate randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, reliable outcome measures, comparable groups at baseline (with specified eligibility criteria), low attrition, acceptable statistical methods, and adequate and faithful adherence to the intervention. They rated studies as fair quality if they did not meet most of the good-quality criteria.</p>
<p>One investigator abstracted data from all included studies into a Microsoft Access&reg; database (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and a second investigator checked the data for accuracy. The investigators abstracted study design characteristics, population demographics, baseline history of depression and other mental health conditions, screening and intervention details (if applicable), depression outcomes, other health outcomes (e.g., suicidality, mortality, quality of life, functioning, health status, child/infant outcomes, emergency department visits, or inpatient stays), adverse events, and diagnostic accuracy outcomes (if applicable).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators created summary tables for all key questions showing study, population, and intervention characteristics (if applicable) and outcomes for qualitative evidence synthesis. They used these tables and forest plots of results to examine data for consistency, precision, and relationship of effect size with key potential modifiers such as treatment contact time, control group recovery or response, and time to follow-up. The investigators had sufficient data with acceptable comparability between studies to conduct meta-analysis only for trials examining the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or related approaches to treat depression in pregnant and postpartum women compared to usual care or other control conditions. The investigators ran a random-effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird pooled estimate, which they felt was acceptable given that the body of evidence for this outcome consisted of 10 studies, with low statistical heterogeneity and fairly comparable sample sizes. Because the number of studies was fairly small, the investigators also ran a sensitivity analysis using a restricted maximum likelihood model with the Knapp-Hartung modification for small samples. They used Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) for all analyses. When the investigators pooled 10 or more studies, they also examined forest plots and ran Egger's test to examine funnel plot asymmetry, which is an indicator of small study bias, sometimes related to publication bias.</p>
<p>For the studies of instrument accuracy, the investigators calculated sensitivity and specificity with Jeffrey's confidence intervals (CIs), using data from 2x2 tables that included true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. If these data were not reported directly, they created 2x2 tables based on the total sample size, number of persons with the diagnosis according to the reference standard, sensitivity, and specificity. Several studies only verified a negative screening result in a random sample of participants scoring below a predetermined threshold (which was lower than the typical cutoff for a positive result in all cases). For these studies, the investigators applied the proportion with a depressive disorder according to the reference standard to the full sample of participants scoring below the threshold and calculated sensitivity and specificity based on these extrapolated results. In all cases, there were no false negatives, so sensitivity did not change, but specificity increased with extrapolation. Side-by-side plots of sensitivity and specificity were created in R, version 3.2.2. (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).</p></div></p>

<p class="Note">*<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the Task Force constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></span></p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from July 28, 2015, to August 24, 2015. A number of comments requested a more detailed definition of what constitutes an "adequate system" for screening. The USPSTF revised the implementation section to clarify that arrange of staff types, organizational arrangements, and settings can be used to support the goals of depression screening and provided a link to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration registry of evidence-based mental health interventions as a resource. Comments suggested that access to depression screening and management resources would be useful. The USPSTF has now provided links to evidence-based depression screening and management toolkits for primary care settings. There were several requests to clarify the potential harms of SSRIs; in response, the USPSTF added information to the Discussion section. Finally, many concerns were expressed about barriers to effectively implementing screening within adequate systems of care; the USPSTF noted this as a research need.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</strong></span></p>
<p>Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Preventive Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, and the Community Preventive Services Task Force.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="/web/20180713024138/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49978&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2fPage%2fName%2fmethods-and-processes" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713024138im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size <em>Guide to Clinical Preventive Services</em>.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div></p>
