<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Statements</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Laboratories should adopt synoptic reporting as a component of bone marrow pathology reports for clearly defined neoplasia or widely applied classification schemes and receive appropriate institutional support. (<strong>Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>When reporting on peripheral blood specimens for bone marrow synoptic reports, laboratories should report clinically and diagnostically pertinent elements, if available. These key elements may include one or more parameters from complete blood cell count, absolute cell counts, and relevant morphologic descriptors. (<strong>Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>When reporting bone marrow aspirate results, laboratories should report clinically and diagnostically pertinent elements in the synoptic section. These key elements may include the evidence-based parameters, such as blast percentage, dysplasia, myeloid to erythroid ratio, morphology of myeloid/lymphoid elements, and enumeration of lymphoid elements and plasma cells; additional elements may be included in nonsynoptic sections of the report. (<strong>Strong recommendation for blast percentage; Recommendation for all other parameters</strong>) </li>
    <li>When reporting bone marrow core biopsy results, laboratories should report clinically or diagnostically pertinent elements in the synoptic section. These key elements may include the evidence-based parameters, such as fibrosis, cellularity, distribution pattern of hematopoietic elements, morphology of lymphoid elements, and enumeration of lymphoid elements and plasma cells; additional elements may be included in the nonsynoptic sections of the report. (<strong>Strong recommendation for fibrosis; Recommendation for all other parameters</strong>) </li>
    <li>If relevant ancillary testing studies are performed on the primary sample (blood or bone marrow), laboratories should report the results, general methodology, performance site, and interpretation site or have the data readily available. If the results are not available, pending status should be stated explicitly. (<strong>Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should include in the synoptic section of the report data groups for diagnosis, supporting studies, and ancillary data that are critical for diagnosis. Key morphologic descriptors should be included and may be in the diagnosis line if they are critical or a component of the disease classification. The diagnosis (or diagnosis group) should head the synoptic section when possible. A narrative, interpretative comment should immediately follow the synoptic section if required. (<strong>Strong recommendation for inclusion of data groups for diagnosis, supporting studies, and ancillary data; Recommendation for the layout of the data groups</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should consider the integrity of electronic data transmission for formatting and data presentation of synoptic reports. (<strong>Strong recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>No recommendation was made regarding the inclusion of coding terms in a synoptic report because coding terms are distinct from scientific terms and vary considerably among health authorities, payers, and different countries. (<strong>No recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should include clinical and laboratory data required for a definitive diagnosis in the synoptic section, along with its source(s), if applicable. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>) </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Management</span></strong></p>
<p>The data elements from an included article/document were extracted by one reviewer into standard data formats and tables developed using systematic review database software (DistillerSR, Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, Canada); a second reviewer confirmed accuracy and completeness. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved by discussion. A bibliographic database was established in EndNote (Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, CA) to track all literature identified and reviewed during the study.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>An assessment of the quality of the evidence (risk of bias assessment) was performed for all retained studies following application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria by a contracted methodologist. Using this method, studies deemed to be of low quality were not excluded from the systematic review but were retained and their methodological strengths and weaknesses were discussed where relevant. Studies were assessed by confirming the presence of items related to both internal and external validity, which are all associated with methodological rigor and a decrease in the risk of bias. (Refer to the supplemental digital content [SDC] [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for items relating to internal and external validity.) The quality assessment of the studies was performed by determining the risk of bias by assessing key indicators, based on study design, against known criteria.</p>
<p>For strength of the evidence, the panel considered the level of evidence, its quantity, and the quality of included studies. The level of evidence was based on the study design as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Level I was evidence from systematic reviews or clinical practice guidelines of appropriate level II studies </li>
    <li>Level II was evidence from good-quality, randomized, controlled trials </li>
    <li>Level III was evidence from low-quality comparative studies </li>
    <li>Level IV was evidence from studies without a comparator (see also Table 1 of the original guideline document) </li>
</ul>
<p>In general, evidence from levels I and II is considered most appropriate for answering clinical questions, but in the absence of such high-quality evidence, the panel considered data from lower-quality studies. The quantity of evidence refers to the number of studies and the number of cases included for each outcome in the recommendation. The quality of studies reflects how well the studies were designed to eliminate bias and threats to validity.</p>
<p>The appropriateness of the study design and data collected, the relevance and clarity of the findings, and the adequacy of the conclusions were evaluated. Each study was assessed individually (refer to the SDC for individual assessments and results) and then summarized by study type. Components such as generalizability and applicability were also considered when determining the strength of evidence. A summary of the overall quality of the evidence was given after considering the evidence in totality. Ultimately, the designation (i.e., rating or grade) of the strength of evidence is a judgment by the expert panel of their level of confidence that the evidence from the studies informing the recommendations reflects true effect. See the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field for a description of the grades for strength of evidence.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center (the Center) convened an expert panel (EP) consisting of pathologists, a hematologist/oncologist, and a methodologist consultant to develop an evidence-based guideline to formalize the basic components of a synoptic report for hematologic neoplasms. CAP approved the appointment of the project chair and panel members. The EP members performed the systematic evidence review. An advisory panel (AP) of pathologists, a hematologist/oncologist, and a molecular biologist also helped in the development of the guideline. The role of the AP members was to provide guidance and feedback on the key questions for the literature search, vet the draft guideline statements prior to the public comment period, and to review and provide feedback for the manuscript and supplemental digital content (SDC).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessing the Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Development of recommendations required that the panel review the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments. Grades for strength of recommendations were developed by the CAP Center and are described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></strong></p>
<p>The expert panel met 21 times through teleconference webinars from February 2, 2012, through March 31, 2015. Additional work was completed via electronic mail. The panel met in person on November 2, 2013, to review evidence to date and to draft recommendations. An open comment period was held from April 21, 2014, through May 19, 2014, on the CAP Web site. Ten draft recommendations and 2 demographic questions were posted for peer review. </p>
<p><em>Agree</em> and <em>disagree</em> responses were captured for every proposed recommendation. The Web site also received 178 written comments. All 10 draft recommendations achieved more than 80% agreement. Each expert panel member was assigned 3 pages of comments to review and summarize. After consideration of the comments, 2 draft recommendations were maintained with the original language; 6 were revised, and 2 draft recommendations were combined into one for 9 final recommendations. Resolution of all changes was obtained by unanimous consensus of the panel members using nominal group technique (rounds of teleconference webinars, email discussions, and multiple, edited recommendations). Final expert panel recommendations were approved by a formal vote. The panel considered laboratory efficiency and feasibility throughout the entire process although neither cost nor cost-effectiveness analyses were performed.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the methods and systematic review used for this guideline can be found in the SDC (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

    <li>The benefits of implementing synoptic reports for bone marrow pathology reports include standardization of reporting, ease of comprehension, consistency, completeness/thoroughness, reproducibility, availability of data for downstream use, and the ability for cross-institutional comparable reporting. Ultimately the expert panel believes that these factors will improve the overall quality of patient care. </li>
    <li>Incorporation of clinical and ancillary information represents good medical practice and further promotes the concept of a diagnostic management team as the optimal approach to patient care by helping to reach a clinicopathologic diagnosis relevant for treatment and outcome. </li>

    <li>The cost and time involved in creating/implementing synoptic reporting systems might pose a challenge for some institutions. Nonetheless, the panel concludes that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects is in favor of synoptic reporting. </li>
    <li>While there might be increased costs in adding critical ancillary data to the synoptic report, the costs that might incur were deemed to be small relative to the net benefits of the information provided. The expert panel also acknowledges that timeliness in reporting might be delayed. </li>
    <li>As a result of standardizing the synoptic report, one might experience inconvenience in transcribing the report or a lack of autonomy. The expert panel believes that the value of standardization outweighs these inconveniences. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center as a forum to create and maintain evidence-based practice guidelines and consensus statements. Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and expert consensus supported in practice. They are intended to assist physicians and patients in clinical decision-making and to identify questions and settings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific information, new evidence may emerge between the time a practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and when it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines and statements address only the topics specifically identified therein and are not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances and preferences. The CAP makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding guidelines and statements and specifically exclude any warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use or purpose. The CAP assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this statement or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>There is an absence of recommendations pertaining to the quality of the primary bone marrow specimen. Although a high-quality specimen is desirable for optimal diagnostic workup, the minimum requirements depend on clinical circumstances and diagnostic needs. Because high-level evidence is not readily available for all scenarios, this was considered out of the scope for formal evidence-based recommendations at this time. The reader is referred to the CAP Cancer Protocols and existing guidelines pertaining to specimen quality. </li>
