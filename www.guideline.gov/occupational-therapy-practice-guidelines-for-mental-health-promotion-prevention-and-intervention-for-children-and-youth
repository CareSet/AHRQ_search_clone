<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes, and the balance of the benefits and harms may result either in a recommendation that occupational therapy practitioners routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients or in no recommendation as the balance of the benefits and harm is too close to justify a general recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;Recommend that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;Insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>

    <li>To serve as a reference for teachers and other related services personnel, school principals and administrators, health care professionals, health care facility managers, education and health care regulators, third-party payers, and managed care organizations </li>
    <li>To present a public health model to envision and guide occupational therapy services in the promotion of mental health and prevention and intervention of mental ill health for school, community, and health care settings </li>

<ul class="contentListFont">
    <li>Tier 1: Universal Mental Health Promotion and Prevention Services &ndash; Services at this level are geared toward the entire population, including children and youth with or without mental health or behavioral problems, as well as with other disabilities and illnesses. At the universal level, the occupational therapy process focuses less on direct, individualized care and more on indirect services geared toward groups of children and youth. </li>
    <li>Tier 2: Targeted Mental Health Services &ndash; Targeted interventions are designed to support children and youth who have learning, emotional, or life experiences that place them at risk of engaging in problematic behavior and/or developing mental health challenges. </li>
    <li>Tier 3: Intensive Mental Health Services &ndash; Intensive individualized services are provided for children and youth with identified mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders that limit participation in needed and desired areas of occupational performance. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The following focused question was included in the review:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What is the effectiveness of activity-based interventions for mental health promotion, prevention and intervention with children and youth? The interventions include those focused on peer and social interaction; compliance with adult directives and social rules and norms; and participation in productive and task-focused behavior. </li>
</ul>
<p>To conduct the evidence-based literature review, reviewers evaluated research studies published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and levels of evidence. The evidence-based reviews incorporated into the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) Practice Guidelines consist of a review and ranking of the literature relevant to occupational therapy interventions published since 1980 used to treat a variety of clinical conditions. An initial review covered articles published between 1980 and 2002. An updated review included articles published between 2003 and 2009. In addition, more recent articles covering the period 2010 to 2012 were included on the basis of recommendations from content experts in the field. Specific inclusion criteria were as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The article was published either in a peer-reviewed journal or in a peer-reviewed evidence-based review since 1980 in the English language. </li>
    <li>The age range of study participants was 3 to 21 years. </li>
    <li>The intervention described in each study was embedded in activities and within the domain of occupational therapy, although it did not have to be a common occupational therapy intervention or administered by an occupational therapist or an occupational therapy assistant. </li>
    <li>The outcomes measured in the study included social or peer interactions or compliance with adult directives or social rules and norms. </li>
    <li>Level I, II, and III evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). </li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusion criteria were the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Presentations and conference proceedings </li>
    <li>Non&ndash;peer-reviewed literature </li>
    <li>Dissertations and theses </li>
    <li>Study did not include an activity-based component </li>
    <li>Study was outside the scope of occupational therapy practice </li>
    <li>Level IV and V evidence </li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewers and AOTA staff first identified search terms, and these were reviewed by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table B.2 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to populations and interventions included in each systematic review. For the updated review, additional search terms were added to reflect changes in terminology that had taken place since the earlier review. Search terms for the updated reviews were developed by the consultant to the AOTA Evidence-Based Practice Project and AOTA staff in consultation with the author of the questions and were reviewed by the advisory group. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all updated searches.</p>
<p>The following sources were searched:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, ERIC, EMBASE, PsycINFO; OTseeker was included in the updated review) </li>
    <li>Consolidated information sources (e.g., evidence-based medicine reviews, including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness) </li>
</ul>
<p>The AOTA consultant completed the initial review of the database results. The updated review was completed by an academic partnership of Susan Nochajski and master's students in occupational therapy at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. The team of reviewers also scanned the bibliographies of selected key articles.</p></div></p>

                    <p>Systematic Review with Evidence Tables</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>After the literature search, reviewers then evaluated the quality of the studies and ranked them using the evidence-based standards described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field."</p>
<p>The teams working on the focused question reviewed the articles according to their quality and levels of evidence. Each article included in the review then was abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of the article and an appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the study based on design and methodology. American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) staff and the evidence-based practice project consultant reviewed the evidence tables to ensure quality control. All studies identified by the review are summarized in Appendix C of the original guideline document. (Readers are encouraged to read the full articles for more details.)</p>
<p>The articles included in the systematic review have several overarching limitations, including the following: small sample size; wide variation in interventions, diagnoses, and clinical conditions; wide variation in outcomes measured; and the use of self-report outcome measures. Depending on the level of evidence, there may have been a lack of randomization, lack of control group, and limited statistical reporting. A wide range of diagnoses and clinical conditions may have been included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews incorporated in these reviews.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The evidence-based literature review undertaken for this Practice Guideline examined studies that evaluated the effects of activity-based intervention on peer and social interaction, compliance with adult directives and social rules and norms, or productive or task-focused behavior in individuals from ages 3 to 21 years at the universal, targeted, and intensive tiers. These topics were chosen by a consensus group of clinical experts, because it was felt that these areas were the most representative of the psychosocial components that predict participation in school and in the home and community. In other words, on the basis of expert opinion, children who were able to interact in peer and social environments and/or comply with adult directives and engage in task behavior were more likely to successfully participate in school and in the home and community environments.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes, and the balance of the benefits and harms may result either in a recommendation that occupational therapy practitioners routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients or in no recommendation as the balance of the benefits and harm is too close to justify a general recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;Recommend that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;Insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>It is important to consider the possibility that some well-meaning prevention efforts may be more harmful than beneficial to children who are overweight. Child obesity prevention programs and untested health education messages have the potential to further stigmatize children who are overweight. The majority of children who are overweight are well aware of their body size and are at risk of developing a poor body image. Negatively focused health messages (e.g., that emphasize the undesirability of being overweight) may lead students to feel worse about themselves. Professionals must carefully consider how prevention messages are framed in order to avoid the potential psychosocial (e.g., poor self-esteem) and physical health (e.g., binge dieting) consequences that can result.</p></div></p>
