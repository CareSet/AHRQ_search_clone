<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, "Strong" or "Weak." A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Strong for</strong> (or "The Work Group recommends offering this option &hellip;") </li>
    <li><strong>Weak for</strong> (or "The Work Group suggests offering this option &hellip;") </li>
    <li><strong>Weak against</strong> (or "The Work Group suggests not offering this option &hellip;") </li>
    <li><strong>Strong against</strong> (or "The Work Group recommends against offering this option &hellip;") </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed "Conditional," "Discretionary," or "Qualified." Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The clinical practice guideline (CPG) Champions were tasked with identifying key evidence questions to guide the systematic review of the literature on hypertension (HTN). These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations. The key questions follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 in the original guideline document provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology.</p>
<p>The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Table A-2 in the original guideline document contains the final set of key questions (KQs) used to guide the systematic review for this CPG.</p>
<p><strong>Conducting the Systematic Review</strong></p>
<p>The methods guiding this systematic review are described below. In part, these methods follow the guidelines for conducting a systematic review set forth by AHRQ in the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews. The methods also follow the guidance set forth by the VA/DoD in the Guideline for Guidelines document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The Lewin Group conducted a systematic review in support of this VA/DoD CPG. The target population considered in the systematic review was outpatient adults ages 18 years or older. The systematic review did not address pregnant women, peri-operative/inpatient adults, children or adolescent populations. The review addressed various management strategies for patients with HTN. This included assessing the benefits and harms associated with antihypertensive pharmacologic therapies as well as the blood pressure thresholds to initiate therapy and appropriate blood pressure targets. In addition to physician-directed management strategies, the review assessed the impact of non-pharmacologic therapies (e.g., weight reduction, sodium reduction, physical activity) in reducing HTN. The review also evaluated what measurement techniques are the best indicators to initiate anti-hypertensive therapy. The target audience of the systematic review and CPG are VA/DoD and other primary care physicians and specialists who treat active and inactive military personnel.</p>
<p>Extensive literature searches identified 19,888 potentially relevant studies. Of those, 19,093 were excluded upon title and abstract review for not meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 799 full-text articles were reviewed of which an additional 649 articles were excluded. Articles excluded from the evidence base for a particular key question were removed for one or more of the following reasons: the article was published before 1966, the article was not in English, the study type did not qualify, the study population was not a relevant population of interest, the intervention was not relevant, the comparator was not relevant, the outcomes examined were not relevant, the study setting was not relevant, the sample size was &lt;100, or the study follow-up period was less than one year.</p>
<p>Overall, 150 publications addressed one or more of the Key Questions and comprised the evidence base for this literature review. Table A-2 in the original guideline document indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions. Figure A-1 in the original guideline document displays a summary of the phases of the systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria </strong></p>
<p>To guide the collection of evidence, the team developed an initial set of inclusion and exclusion criteria that was discussed and agreed upon by the CPG Champions. While there are some overarching criteria for the review, the team also established individual sets of inclusion and exclusion criteria for each of the key questions, as necessary.</p>
<p>In some cases, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were influenced by recently published systematic evidence reviews or other publications. The utilization of previous publications as a starting point to address all or some of the key questions allowed the current literature search to be more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>Figure A-2 in the original guideline document presents the overarching criteria that were applied to the literature searches and to the review of resulting literature identified through these searches.</p>
<p>A "best available evidence" approach was implemented to sort the evidence for the systematic review. To be included in the systematic review, a study must be a prospective, randomized or nonrandomized (observational) controlled trial with an independent, concurrent control group. If no high quality intervention trials are available to address a particular key question, relevant observational studies were identified and included in the systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Detailed search logic reflecting the PICOTS of interest were developed for each key question and used to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and other study design types as needed. The literature searches were conducted using the following bibliographic and other databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). The CPG Champions also contributed articles as part of the evidence generation step.</p>
<p>The literature search strategies incorporated key text terms identified from an initial review of relevant systematic reviews and primary research studies on related topics (including how they are indexed in their respective databases, e.g., use of medical subject headings [MeSH] in PubMed, EMTREE terms in EMBASE) and any terms identified by the CPG Champions or members of the evidence review team, including a clinical and research expert on the subject matter. Members of the evidence review team including a librarian, as needed, reviewed the search strategies developed to ensure comprehensiveness. Duplicates of studies were discarded during the search process so that each publication is represented only once in the resulting evidence base for each key question.</p>
<p>The search strategies employed combinations of free-text keywords as well as controlled vocabulary terms including (but not limited to) MeSH and EMTREE terms. Search sets were structured to address specific key questions and sub-questions. The strategies for PubMed are presented first in the original guideline document, followed by the search strategies used in EMBASE and in Cochrane, including CENTRAL, CDSR and DARE. Searches of EMBASE and Cochrane were conducted in parallel with searches in PubMed.</p>
<p>For PubMed, two searches strategies were constructed for each key question. The first retrieved studies that are indexed in PubMed, and the second strategy captured any relevant studies which were in the process of being indexed or had not yet been indexed.</p>
<p>See Appendix A in the original guideline document for more details of the literature search strategies for each key question.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>​The methodology used in developing the 2014 clinical practice guideline (CPG) follows the <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal document of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the submission of an updated Hypertension (HTN) CPG.</p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Specifically, the Champions for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance and interest for the diagnosis and management of patients with HTN. In addition, the Champions assisted in:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Conducting the evidence review, including providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria </li>
    <li>Assessing the level and quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes. </li>
</ol>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Clinical Performance Assurance Directorate, Office of Evidence-Based Practice, US Army Medical Command, the lead agency for the DoD, identified two clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 HTN CPG.</p>
<p>The Lewin Team (Team), including DutyFirst Consulting, was contracted by VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The Team held the first conference call in September 2013, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leaders from the VA and DoD evidence-based guideline development program, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review about the diagnosis and management of HTN. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the diagnosis and management of HTN, from which the Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: Primary Care, Internal Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Dietetic and Nutritional Services, Geriatrics, and Physical Therapy.</p>
<p>The guideline development process for the 2014 CPG consisted of the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Formulating evidence questions (Key Questions) </li>
    <li>Conducting the systematic review </li>
    <li>Convening a three and a half day face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of HTN to the VA/DoD EBPWG. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reconciling 2004 Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The HTN Guideline Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the key questions. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Guideline Work Group considered the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the previous CPG on management of HTN, published in 2004, subject to evolving practice in today's environment. Subject to Guideline Work Group consensus, recommendations that were no longer relevant to the current practice environment, or were otherwise out of scope for this CPG, were not carried forward to this CPG. Recommendations that were considered to be relevant to the current practice environment and still in scope for this CPG, and that required no substantive (i.e., entailing clinically meaningful) rewording, were carried forward in this CPG. The wording was, however, modified slightly to be best utilized in today's clinical environment and to uphold the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendation format.&nbsp; For some modified recommendations, the Guideline Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2004 CPG, though not all of these were the object of a systematic evidence review for the 2004 CPG. Some modified recommendations carried forward from the 2004 HTN CPG, however, were based on an updated systematic review conducted since the 2004 HTN CPG due to the topic being a priority area addressed by the key questions. These "modified" recommendations, and whether or not an updated systematic review was conducted, are noted in the list of recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The Guideline Work Group recognized the need to accommodate the transition in evidence rating systems from the 2004 CPG to the current CPG. In order to report the strength of all recommendations using a consistent format (i.e., the GRADE system), the Guideline Work Group converted the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strengths of the recommendation accompanying the carryover recommendations from the 2004 guideline to the GRADE system. As such, the Guideline Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recommendation in the 2004 CPG as well as harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where possible. In some instances, peer-reviewed literature published since the 2004 CPG was considered along with the evidence base used for that CPG. Where such newer literature was considered when converting the strength of the recommendation from the USPSTF to GRADE system, it is noted in the discussion that follows the corresponding recommendation.</p>
<p>The Guideline Work Group recognizes that, while there are practical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous systematic review or previous recommendations or recent peer-reviewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive systematic review and therefore may introduce bias.</p>
<p><strong>Convening the Face-to-Face Meeting</strong></p>
<p>In consultation with the Contracting Officer Representative, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and a half day face-to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on April 8-11, 2014. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2004 HTN CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review of the key questions in order to facilitate and inform the process.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to retain, revise, or reject each recommendation from the 2004 HTN CPG. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations, not presented in the 2004 HTN CPG, based on the 2014 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into two smaller subgroups at this meeting.</p>
<p>Following the drafting of clinical practice recommendations, the Work Group assigned a grade for each recommendation based on GRADE methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Grading Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes </li>
    <li>Confidence in the quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Values and preferences </li>
    <li>Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Resource Use </li>
        <li>Equity </li>
        <li>Acceptability </li>
        <li>Feasibility </li>
        <li>Subgroup considerations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for further descriptions of each domain.</p>
<p>Table A-3 in the original guideline document ("Evidence to Recommendations Framework") was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain.</p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which combines the four domains. GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low. In these types of instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation.</p>
<p>The GRADE of a recommendation is based on the following elements:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction </li>
    <li>Relative strength (Strong or Weak) </li>
    <li>Direction (For or Against) </li>
</ul>
<p>See also the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Drafting and Submitting the Final CPG</strong></p>
<p>Following the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments for the update of specific sections of the 2004 HTN CPG that would form the narrative text for the 2014 HTN CPG. During this time, the Champions also revised the 2004 HTN algorithms and identified the content for the guideline summary and pocket card, as part of the provider toolkits that will be developed by the Office of Evidence-Based Practice, HQ MEDCOM following the publication of the 2014 HTN CPG. The algorithms will be included as part of this HTN CPG so as to provide a clear description of the flow of patient care. The final 2014 HTN CPG was submitted to the EBPWG in October 2014.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, "Strong" or "Weak." A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation.</p>
<p>Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences.</p>
<p>Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Strong For</strong> (or "The Work Group recommends offering this option &hellip;") </li>
    <li><strong>Weak For</strong> (or "The Work Group suggests offering this option &hellip;") </li>
    <li><strong>Weak Against</strong> (or "The Work Group suggests not offering this option &hellip;") </li>
    <li><strong>Strong Against</strong> (or "The Work Group recommends against offering this option &hellip;") </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed "Conditional," "Discretionary," or "Qualified." Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary.</p></div></p>

    <li>Medications which act through the renin-angiotensin system (i.e., ACEIs and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) should be avoided during pregnancy since they can lead to renal dysgenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, intrauterine growth restriction, or death of the fetus. Direct renin inhibitors may carry a similar risk and should also be avoided. Spironolactone and renin-angiotensin system blockers should be avoided in women of child-bearing potential due to their anti-androgenic effects during fetal development and concern for undervirilization of a male fetus. Providers should enter a discussion with women about their plans for pregnancy or birth control prior to the initiation of medications for the treatment of hypertension (HTN). </li>
    <li>Avoid concomitant use of ACEI with ARB or direct renin inhibitor due to increased risk of hypotension, syncope, increased K+, and changes in renal function. </li>
