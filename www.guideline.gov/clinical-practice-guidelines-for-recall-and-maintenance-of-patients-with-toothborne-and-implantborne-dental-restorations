<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Practice Guidelines for Recall and Maintenance of Patients with Tooth-Borne Dental Restorations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Recall</strong></p>
<p>Patients with tooth-borne restorations (fixed or removable) should be advised to obtain a dental professional examination at least every 6 months as a lifelong regimen. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients categorized by the dentist as higher risk based on age, ability to perform oral self care, biological or mechanical complications of natural teeth or tooth-borne restorations should be advised to obtain a dental professional examination more often than every 6 months, depending upon the clinical situation. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Professional Maintenance</strong></p>
<p><em>Tooth-Borne Removable Restorations (Partial Removable Dental Prostheses)</em></p>
<p>Professional maintenance for patients with tooth-borne removable restorations should include an extraoral and intraoral health and dental examination, oral hygiene instructions for existing natural teeth and any restorations, oral hygiene intervention (cleaning of natural teeth and restorations), and use of oral topical agents as deemed clinically necessary. (<strong>Strengths of recommendation: A, C, D</strong>)</p>
<p>Professional maintenance of the partial removable dental prostheses should include hygiene instructions, detailed examination of the prosthesis, prosthetic components and patient education about any foreseeable problems that could impair optimal function with the restoration. The partial removable dental prosthesis should be professionally cleaned extraorally using professionally accepted mechanical and chemical methods. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p>Professionals should recommend and/or prescribe appropriate oral topical agents and oral hygiene aids suitable for the patient's at-home maintenance needs. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Tooth-Borne Fixed Restorations (Intracoronal Restorations, Extracoronal Restorations, Veneers, Single Crowns, and Partial Fixed Dental Prostheses)</em></p>
<p>Professional maintenance for patients with tooth-borne fixed restorations should include an extraoral and intraoral health and dental examination, oral hygiene instructions for natural teeth and the fixed restorations, oral hygiene intervention (cleaning of natural teeth and restorations), and use of oral topical agents as deemed clinically necessary. (<strong>Strengths of recommendation: A, C, D</strong>)</p>
<p>Professionals should recommend and/or prescribe appropriate oral topical agents and oral hygiene aids suitable for the patient's at-home maintenance needs. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p>When clinical signs indicate the need for an occlusal device, professionals should educate the patient and fabricate an occlusal device to protect the tooth-borne fixed restorations. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p>Professional maintenance of the occlusal device should include hygiene instructions, detailed examination of the occlusal device, and patient education about any foreseeable problems that could impair optimal function with the occlusal device. The occlusal device should be professionally cleaned extraorally, using professionally accepted mechanical and chemical methods. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>At-Home Maintenance</strong></p>
<p><em>Tooth-Borne Removable Restorations (Partial Removable Dental Prostheses)</em></p>
<p>Patients with tooth-borne removable restorations should be educated about brushing existing natural teeth and restorations twice daily, and the use of oral hygiene aids such as dental floss, water flossers, air flossers, interdental cleaners, and electric toothbrushes. (<strong>Strengths of recommendation: C, D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients with tooth-borne removable restorations should be educated about cleaning their prosthesis at least twice daily using a soft brush and the professional recommended denture-cleaning agent. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients with multiple and complex restorations on existing teeth supporting or surrounding the removable restoration should be advised to use oral topical agents such as toothpaste containing 5000 ppm fluoride or toothpaste with 0.3% triclosan, and to add supplemental short-term use of chlorhexidine gluconate when indicated. (<strong>Strengths of recommendation: A, C, D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients with tooth-borne removable restorations should be advised to remove the restoration while sleeping. The removed prosthesis should be stored in a prescribed cleaning solution.</p>
<p><em>Tooth-Borne Fixed Restorations (Intracoronal Restorations, Extracoronal Restorations, Veneers, Single Crowns, and Partial Fixed Dental Prostheses)</em></p>
<p>Patients with tooth-borne fixed restorations should be educated about brushing twice daily and the use of oral hygiene aids such as dental floss, water flossers, air flossers, interdental cleaners, and electric toothbrushes. (<strong>Strengths of recommendation: A, D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients with multiple and complex restorations on existing teeth should be advised to use oral topical agents such as toothpaste containing 5000 ppm fluoride or toothpaste with 0.3% triclosan, and to add supplemental short-term use of chlorhexidine gluconate when indicated. (<strong>Strengths of recommendation: A, C, D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients prescribed with occlusal devices should be educated to wear the occlusal device during sleep. (<strong>Strength of recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p>Patients prescribed with occlusal devices should be educated about cleaning their occlusal device before and after use, with a soft brush and the prescribed cleaning agent. Patients should also be educated about proper methods for storage of the occlusal device when not in use.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Two separate systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to evaluate the recall and maintenance regimens for tooth- and implant-borne restoration. The detailed methodology for the search processes are described in the respective systematic review articles (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tooth-Borne Restorations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong></p>
<p>An electronic search of the English language literature was performed independently by two investigators using the PubMed search engine and Cochrane Library database. The specific search terms, search string, and limits are presented in Table 1 in the systematic review on tooth-borne restorations.</p>
<p>The specific PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparatives, Outcomes) question for this systematic review was: in patients with tooth-borne restorations, does one specific recall regimen and dental maintenance regimen, or no regimen, improve clinical outcomes and patient care and optimize maintenance of oral health?</p>
<p>The period searched was from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2014. The search limits applied to the electronic search were the English language, search period, and clinical studies. The anticipated tooth-borne restorations of interest in this study were intracoronal restorations, extracoronal restorations, single crowns, veneers, fixed dental prostheses (FDP), and partial removable dental prostheses (RDP).</p>
<p>The predetermined inclusion criteria were (1) English language article in a peer-reviewed journal; (2) any clinical study published between January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2014; and (3) any clinical study with the primary focus on patient recall regimen, professional maintenance, or home maintenance regimen for tooth-borne restorations, in healthy patients.</p>
<p>The predetermined exclusion criteria were (1) articles that did not pertain to items described in the inclusion criteria; (2) articles that did not pertain to the objectives of the systematic review; (3) articles that did not describe data on recall and maintenance of patients with tooth-borne restorations; (4) articles that described data on unhealthy patients or patients with periodontal disease; (5) review articles or technique articles without associated clinical study and data; (6) patients or data being repeated in other included articles; and (7) article description that would not allow extraction of qualitative or quantitative data related to objectives of the study.</p>
<p>The electronic search process was systematically conducted in three stages. A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) format was used as a filter to remove duplicate articles and to ensure a systematic search process. In stage 1, the investigators independently screened all relevant titles of the electronic search, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion. In situations where the application of the exclusion criteria was not clear, the controversial article was included for consideration in the abstract stage. In stage 2, the investigators independently analyzed the abstracts of all selected titles, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. In situations of uncertainty, the abstract was included for the subsequent full-text stage.</p>
<p>After the application of the exclusion criteria, the definitive list of articles was screened at stage 3 by the investigators to extract qualitative and quantitative data (when available). A supplemental electronic search for articles from Scopus, Google Scholar, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) search engines along with a hand search of references of all included articles was conducted using systematic methods. Additionally, articles that had a lag time to appear on the PubMed search engine were also screened for the three stages, as part of the supplemental search. Data from all included studies were then tabulated, analyzed, and compared to satisfy the objectives of the review.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Two separate systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to evaluate the recall and maintenance regimens for tooth-borne and implant-borne restoration. The detailed methodology is described in the respective systematic review articles (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Results from studies reported in these two reviews were scrutinized, tabulated, and analyzed to formulate conclusions and then create the clinical practice guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tooth-Borne Restorations</span></strong></p>
<p>Given the nature of the topic and PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparatives, Outcomes) question posed in this systematic review, the authors did not identify any significant quantitative data. Therefore, no statistical analysis was performed.</p>
<p>To segregate the qualitative data and provide a meaningful method of understanding outcomes, the analyzed data were grouped into three categories: (1) outcomes related to patient-specific restorative treatment; (2) outcomes related to maintenance using oral topical agents, and (3) outcomes related to maintenance using professional intervention (see Table 3 in the systematic review on tooth-borne restorations).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implant-Borne Restorations</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors did not identify a significant amount of quantitative data from the data extraction, which may be related to the nature of the topic and PICO question posed in this systematic review. Therefore, no statistical analysis was performed.</p>
<p>To segregate the qualitative data and provide a meaningful method of understanding outcomes, the analyzed data were grouped into three categories: (1) outcomes related to patient-specific restorative treatment; (2) outcomes related to maintenance using oral topical agents and hygiene aids; and (3) outcomes related to maintenance using professional intervention. Additionally, the professional intervention for patients with implant-borne restorations was dichotomized as biological maintenance and mechanical maintenance (see Table 3 in the systematic review on implant-borne restorations).</p></div></p>

                    <p>Expert Consensus</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>A scientific panel comprising experts appointed by the American College of Prosthodontists (ACP), American Dental Association (ADA), Academy of General Dentistry (AGD), and American Dental Hygienists Association (ADHA) critically evaluated and debated the published evidence from the two systematic reviews on this topic (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). A rating scheme for strength of recommendation as described by Shekelle et al. was used as it was most applicable to this topic and is widely used and validated in the medical literature (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). The major outcomes and consequences considered during formulation of these clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were (1) risk for failure of tooth-borne restorations and (2) risk for failure of implant-borne restorations. Thereafter, the members of the task force conducted a roundtable peer review/evaluation discussion of the proposed guidelines, and the guidelines were debated in detail. These inputs were used to supplement and refine the proposed guidelines, and consensus was attained for the various guidelines presented.</p>
<p>The strength of evidence and subsequent recommendations that is presently available was applied for each guideline. When a guideline comprised multiple aspects, multiple strengths of available recommendations in descending order were applied. Additionally, when multiple strengths of recommendations were available for a specific guideline, they were all applied accordingly.</p>
<p>A potential source of bias that was considered during development of the CPGs was the same group serving as authors of the systematic reviews as well as panel members for the CPG. To minimize this potential bias, efforts were made during the scientific panel meetings to debate and justify each guideline in an open and transparent format. Strength of evidence was debated for every guideline. Thus, the effect of "groupthink" may not be a source of bias in this baseline CPG document. Conversely, having the same author group to draft the CPGs may be viewed as a strength of this document, due to the profound insight obtained by the author group during the systematic review process.</p>
<p>Most of the guidelines in this document are graded as category D for strength of recommendation but it is anticipated that the strength of recommendation would be higher in the future. Using Shekelle's method for grading the strength of recommendation allowed incorporation and delineation of various types of evidence, including expert opinion/consensus, into four categories, while formulating these guidelines. Additionally, it allowed extrapolation of higher categories of evidence to lower categories and provided more freedom in designation of an article to a specific category. The authors considered other widely popular alternatives such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, and the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) method. However, these alternatives were less applicable to the topic of this baseline CPG. The GRADE method divides the expression of evidence into only two categories, weak or strong, which was not appropriate for this baseline CPG. The SORT method divides the strength of recommendation into three categories (A, B and C) but does not allow extrapolation of higher categories of evidence to lower categories.</p></div></p>
