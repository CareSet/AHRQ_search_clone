                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The grades for strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong recommendation</strong>, <strong>Recommendation</strong>, <strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Statements</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Laboratories should ensure that all blocks and slides are unambiguously labeled using 2 patient identifiers. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should ensure that the accession designation used on the surgical pathology report, and all blocks and slides from that accession, includes the case type (surgical pathology versus cytology or autopsy), the year, and a unique accession number. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p>Example: S14-9999 (surgical case&ndash;year-accession number)</p>
    <p><em>Note</em>: Laboratories may position the information in a different format (e.g., 14-9999S, 14S-9999) and may include additional letters that reflect the hospital or clinic site of origin.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If the patient's name is used as one of the patient identifiers, laboratories should ensure that the name format will link the blocks and slides to the correct patient. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p><em>Note</em>: Possible formats include, but are not limited to, full last and first name, full last name with first initial, or an appropriate number of letters of the last and first names.</p>
    </li>
    <li>When an accession number has not yet been assigned (e.g., frozen sections or intraprocedural consultations), laboratories should label the blocks and slides with at least 2 patient identifiers, 1 of which is the patient name. (<strong>Recommendation</strong>)
    <p><em>Note</em>: Possible additional identifiers include, but are not limited to, date of birth, medical record number, or unique health identification number.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Laboratories should label each specimen container with a unique alphanumeric designation that incorporates the accession designation. Each block and slide from that specimen container should be labeled with the same unique alphanumeric designation. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should label each block obtained from a single specimen sequentially with a unique alphanumeric designation that can be unambiguously linked to a gross description within the pathology report. The order should be accession designation, specimen identifier, and block identifier. Laboratories may select the format of the specimen/block identifier. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p>Example: For specimen A, blocks are labeled 1, 2, 3 . . . (S14-9999 A1, A2, A3 . . .) For specimen 1, blocks are labeled A, B, C . . . (S14-9999-1A, 1B, 1C . . .)</p>
    </li>
    <li>When multiple slides are cut from a single block, laboratories should label each slide sequentially in order of cutting. This slide identifier should come after the specimen identifier and block identifier. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p>Example: S14-9999-A1-1, S14-9999-A1-2, S14-9999-A1-3</p>
    <p><em>Note</em>: The laboratory may determine the exact labeling format for multiple slides.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The laboratory should label the slides with the histochemical, immunohistochemical, and/or special procedure (e.g., FS for frozen section, TP for touch preparation, AFB for acid-fast bacteria) after the accession, specimen, block, and slide identifiers. The histochemical technique or specific antibody used should also be included when it may affect the interpretation. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>)
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p>S14-9999-A1-1<br/>
    FS<br/>
    S14-9999-A1-1<br/>
    Cytokeratin (AE1/AE3)<br/>
    S14-9999-A1-1<br/>
    AFB (Ziehl-Neelsen, Wade-Fite, etc)</p>
    <p><em>Note</em>: The panel concludes that surgical pathology slides labeled with terms such as "recut," "level," or "deeper" and slides without an explicit stain name are inherently implied to be a hematoxylin-eosin stain; no additional labeling is required. The panel also concludes that the labeling of control slides or control tissue on test slides is beyond the scope of this guideline; however, the panel concludes that laboratories should establish a clear and standardized method for distinguishing control tissues from patient tissues that can be understood internally and externally.</p>
    </li>
    <li>No recommendation is made regarding standardization of abbreviations and conventions. (<strong>No recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>On paraffin blocks, the accession designation should be the most prominent printed element (i.e., larger font or bolded), followed by the patient name or other second identifier. As long as the ability to read the accession designation and second identifier is not compromised, additional elements may be included as determined by the laboratory. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>On microscopic slides, the accession designation should be the most prominent printed element (i.e., larger font or bolded) followed by the patient name or other second identifier and stain/procedure name. As long as the ability to read these essential elements is not compromised, additional elements may be included as determined by the laboratory. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>
    <li>Laboratories should label blocks and slides received in consultation with their own institution's accession designation. Laboratories should not obscure the original label when relabeling. (<strong>Expert consensus opinion</strong>) </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Management</span></strong></p>
<p>The data elements from an included article/document were extracted by one reviewer into standard data formats and tables developed using systematic review database software (DistillerSR, Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, Canada); a second reviewer confirmed accuracy and completeness. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved by discussion with the methodologist. A bibliographic database was established in EndNote (Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, CA) to track all literature identified and reviewed during the study.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were assessed for strength of evidence, methodologic rigor, and confirmation of validity by a contracted methodologist. The quality assessment of the studies was informed by several instruments, based on study design. The other components of evidence such as generalizability and applicability to labeling of blocks and slides in surgical pathology were also considered when determining the strength of evidence.</p>
<p>For strength of the evidence, the panel considered the level of evidence, its quantity, and quality of included studies. The level of evidence was based on the study design as follows: level I was evidence from systematic reviews of appropriate level II studies; level II was evidence from good-quality randomized controlled trials; level III was evidence from low-quality comparative studies; level IV was evidence from studies without a comparator. In general, level I and II evidence is considered most appropriate to answer clinical questions, but in the absence of such high-quality evidence, the panel considered data from lower-quality studies. The quantity of evidence refers to the number of studies and number of cases included for each outcome in the recommendation. The quality of studies reflects how well the studies were designed to eliminate bias and threats to validity.</p>
<p>The methodologic quality of preimplementation and postimplementation studies was assessed using 4 elements of the Ramsay et al. quality criteria for interrupted time series designs. Scientific quality assessment of prospective case series was informed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination's guidance for reviews. The 3 elements considered included the representativeness of the sample, the sufficiency of the follow-up period, and the application of objective criteria to assess study outcomes. Finally, the qualitative study was assessed for methodologic quality using 5 components of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) 2009 methodology checklist for qualitative studies. The appropriateness of the study design and data collected, relevance and clarity of findings, and adequacy of conclusions were evaluated. Each study was assessed individually, and then studies were summarized by study type. Finally, a summary of the overall quality of the evidence was given considering the evidence in totality.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center convened an expert panel consisting of members with expertise in surgical pathology and histotechnology. Panel members included pathologists, histotechnologists, a methodologist consultant, and CAP staff. The CAP and National Society for Histotechnology (NSH) approved the appointment of the project cochairs and panel members. These panel members served as the expert panel for the systematic evidence review.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessing the Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The central question that the panel addressed in developing the guideline was "What are the essential elements for the proper labeling of paraffin blocks and microscopic slides in the routine practice of surgical pathology?"</p>
<p>Development of recommendations required that the panel review the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the significant findings related to each key question or outcome? Determine any regulatory requirements and/or evidence that support a specific action.
    <ol>
        <li>What is the overall strength of evidence supporting each key question or outcome? Strength of evidence is graded as Convincing, Adequate or Inadequate, based on four published criteria (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Strength of evidence is a key element in determining the strength of a recommendation. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>What is the strength of each recommendation? There are many methods for determining the strength of a recommendation based on the strength of evidence and the magnitude of net benefit or harm. However, such methods have rarely (if ever) been applied to the area of slide/block labeling. Therefore, the method for determining strength of recommendation has been modified for this application (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field), and is based on the strength of evidence and the likelihood that further studies will change the conclusions. Recommendations not supported by evidence (i.e., evidence was missing or insufficient to permit a conclusion to be reached) were made based on consensus expert opinion. Another potential consideration is the likelihood that additional studies will be conducted that fill gaps in knowledge. </li>
    <li>What is the net balance of benefits and harms? The consideration of net balance of benefits and harms will focus on the core recommendation to unambiguously identify blocks and slides in surgical pathology. </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Results</strong></span></p>
<p>As the overall body of available evidence was deemed inadequate to inform the guidelines, the panel relied on expert consensus opinion to formulate 10 of the 12 recommendations. Two of the recommendations were informed by existing regulatory requirements and were further guided by the clinical experience of the panel, resulting in a strong consensus.</p>
<p>The expert panel met 12 times through teleconference webinars from April 2012 through March 2014. Additional work was completed via electronic mail. The panel met in person August 17, 2013, to review evidence to date and draft recommendations and March 22, 2014, to draft the manuscript.</p>
<p>"Agree" and "disagree" responses were captured for every proposed recommendation. The Web site also received 539 written comments. Ten of 13 recommendations achieved more than 80% agreement; the other 3 achieved 78% to 79% agreement. Each expert panel member was assigned 3 or 4 draft recommendations for which to review all comments received and provide an overall summary to the rest of the panel. One draft recommendation was maintained with the original language, 10 were modified with minor changes and/or additions for clarification, and 2 of the draft recommendations were combined, for a total of 12 final recommendations. Resolution of all changes was obtained by majority consensus of the panel using nominal group technique (rounds of teleconference webinars, e-mail discussion, and multiple edited recommendations) among the panel members. The final recommendations were approved by the expert panel with a formal vote. The panel considered laboratory efficiency and the feasibility of the recommendations throughout the entire process.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Panel believes that the use of two identifiers on tissue blocks and slides affords a greater opportunity to avoid error and a greater opportunity to discover an error if one occurs. The use of two identifiers provides an opportunity to correlate and check two data points against each other, providing a greater degree of assurance. For those facilities that use barcodes, the inclusion of human readable identifiers provides a safeguard against printer failures which can yield barcodes that will not scan, system downtime occurrences, and the occurrence of barcodes from one institution that may be unreadable at a second institution where a consultation is sought. </li>
    <li>The Panel further believes that implementation of a uniform labeling standard with regard to the specific elements needed to unambiguously link each tissue block and the slides derived from it with a specific patient and tissue source will decrease the likelihood that these preparations will be misinterpreted within an institution or in other facilities to which they may be referred. </li>
</ul></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>For laboratories that label cassettes and slides by hand, incorporation of additional information in fields that have limited space will be challenging and force individuals to write more carefully and deliberately. Rushed labeling may lead to illegible notations and increased identification errors. The use of two identifiers will therefore force individuals to slow down, which may negatively impact workflow in busy laboratories, affecting sample turnaround times.</p></div></p>

Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and expert consensus supported in practice. They are intended to assist physicians and patients in clinical decision making and to identify questions and settings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific information, new evidence may emerge between the time a practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and when it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines and statements address only the topics specifically identified therein and are not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and statements cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances and preferences.

<p>Prior to acceptance on the expert panel, potential members completed the College of American Pathologists (CAP) conflict of interest disclosure process, whose policy and form (in effect April 2010) require disclosure of material financial interest in or potential for benefit of significant value from the guideline's development or its recommendations 12 months prior through the time of publication. Potential members completed the conflict of interest disclosure form, listing any relationship that could be interpreted as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict. Everyone was required to disclose conflicts prior to beginning and continuously throughout the project's timeline. Disclosed conflicts of the expert panel members are listed in the appendix of the original guideline document. Please see the supplemental digital content (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for full details on the conflict of interest policy.</p></div></p>
