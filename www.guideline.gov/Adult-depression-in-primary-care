                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI)</strong>: The recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of major depression in adults in primary care are presented in the form of a table with a list of evidence-based recommendations and an algorithm with 12 components, accompanied by detailed annotations. The algorithm is provided in the original guideline document (see the "Guideline Availability" field). </p>
<p>Quality of evidence (Low Quality, Moderate Quality, and High Quality) and strength of recommendation (Weak or Strong) ratings are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Clinicians should routinely screen all adults for depression using a standardized instrument. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: There is evidence that screening adults who one suspects as being depressed improves outcomes. There is low to moderate evidence that screening all adults, pregnant and postpartum women improves outcomes even in the absence of treatment protocols, care managers and specialty trained providers. There is less evidence supporting this recommendation with geriatric patients. The benefit is that one would be finding and treating many more depressed patients and improving their outcomes/functioning not only for depression but for the other medical diseases with depression as a comorbidity. There is also some evidence that this might save overall medical costs for depressed patients. The optimum interval at which to screen for depression is unknown; more evidence for all populations is needed to identify ideal screening intervals. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: The only harm identified is the cost of screening patients who are not depressed. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Although direct evidence of the isolated health benefit of depression screening in primary care is weak, the totality of the evidence supports the benefits of screening in pregnant and postpartum and general adult populations, particularly in the presence of additional treatment supports such as treatment protocols, care management and availability of specially trained depression care providers. Evidence is least supportive of screening in older adults, where direct evidence is most limited. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: O'Connor et al., 2016; Kroenke et al., 2010; Duffy et al., 2008; Gilbody et al., 2006; Rush et al., 2003. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Clinicians should use the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition</em> (DSM-5) criteria to determine diagnosis of major depression, persistent depressive disorder, other specified depressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Guideline; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Proper use of diagnostic criteria assists in accurately diagnosing and directing the treatment plan toward appropriate evidence-based interventions. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: There is a risk of exclusively utilizing the criteria in a checklist manner, which could lead to inappropriate diagnosis and treatment. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: With proper training and education, the proper use of the diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5 aids in driving the correct diagnosis and proper evidence-based interventions, which outweighs any potential harm. </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Major Depressive Disorder Treatment Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<p>Consider combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatments for patients with major depressive disorder when practical, feasible, available and affordable. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The preponderance of moderate quality literature shows that outcomes are better when pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatments are combined than either treatment alone. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: The potential negative cumulative impact of time away from work and family to do psychotherapy, office visits to do psychotherapy, and potential side effects of medications could affect the patients. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: When balancing better outcomes of the combined treatment with negative impacts of treatment on patients, the group felt the benefits of combined treatment outweigh the potential harms. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Cuijpers et al., 2014; Hollon et al., 2014; Peeters et al., 2013; Spijker et al., 2013; van Hees et al., 2013; Cuijpers et al., 2012; Jakobsen et al., 2012; Guidi et al., 2011; Oestergaard &amp; M&oslash;ldrup, 2011; Cuijpers et al., "Adding," 2009; Cuijpers et al., "Psychotherapy," 2009; de Maat et al., 2008. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Depressive Disorder Treatment Recommendation 2</strong></p>
<p>When unable to do combined therapy due to patient preference or availability/affordability of the treatments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Consider starting with psychotherapy for mild to moderate major depression </li>
    <li>Consider starting with pharmacotherapy for severe major depression </li>
</ol>
<p>(<strong>Quality of Evidence: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Weak</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Generally, the evidence shows that both medication and therapy are reasonably effective. For mild to moderate major depression, psychotherapy alone may lengthen the time to relapse and patients may be more successfully withdrawn from the medications. For severe major depression, it appears that medications have a significantly higher effect size than psychotherapy. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: For mild to moderate major depression, disruptions include taking time for office visits to do psychotherapy, and time away from work and family. For severe major depression, these are the potential side effects of medications. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Even though the quality of the majority of individual articles are moderate to high, the overall literature is quite weak in documenting harms, availability and costs to the individual patient. There was no scientific or easy way to directly compare the benefits to costs. The seasoned clinicians in the group chose to go with the benefits in terms of somewhat better outcomes based upon the literature but qualify this by making the recommendations weak. This is an area where shared decision-making is likely to be especially valuable. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Cuijpers et al., 2015; Kuyken et al., 2015; Biesheuvel-Leliefeld et al., 2014; Menchetti et al., 2014; Steinert et al., 2014; Cuijpers et al., 2013; Piet &amp; Hougaard, 2011; Segal et al., 2010; Dobson et al., 2008 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pure Dysthymia Treatment Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Consider starting with medication in pure dysthymia patients. The work group feels that it is reasonable to consider stepped care, which includes augmenting medications and adding psychotherapy for patients who don't improve. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Antidepressant treatment of pure dysthymia outperforms both placebo and psychotherapy in acute trials and can begin to reverse the symptoms, suffering and impairment of a condition that can go on for decades left untreated. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: A significant percentage of patients will fail to respond and require additional treatment. For those who ultimately require a trial of psychotherapy and benefit from it, starting medication first will have represented a delay in receiving effective care. Antidepressants and augmenting agents have side effects and adverse interactions with other drugs. It is not clear how long to continue psychotherapy that has not yet started to work. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Evidence supports starting with antidepressant medication, and one can choose later to add psychotherapy for those who fail to respond or recover. It is reasonable to start with antidepressant medication since it tends to work more quickly than psychotherapy. Access to high-quality psychotherapy is not available in many primary care settings. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Kriston et al., 2014; von Wolff et al., 2013; Cuijpers, 2012; Levkovitz, Tedeschini, &amp; Papakostas, 2011; Cuijpers et al., 2010; Cuijpers et al., "Is psychotherapy," 2009; Imel et al., 2008; Markowitz et al., 2005; Browne et al., 2002. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chronic Major Depression Treatment Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>For patients with chronic major depression, start with combined antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Antidepressant treatment with psychotherapy outperforms either treatment as monotherapy and more rapidly begins the process of reversing symptoms, suffering and functional impairment in a condition that can go on for decades untreated. Psychotherapy can produce quality-of-life improvements and lower health and human services costs. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Combined medication and psychotherapy increase short-term costs. Access to high-quality psychotherapy is not available in many primary care settings. In a 2000 study of chronic major depression, which excluded pure dysthymic disorder, the overall drop-out rate was the same for the three treatment groups, but reasons for dropping out varied. More patients dropped out of the medication-alone arm because of adverse events, and more psychotherapy patients withdrew consent because therapy was too time consuming, they did not want psychotherapy, or they wanted medication. This highlights the need to consider patient preferences. The benefits of psychotherapy are delayed and may cause some patients to give up on it prematurely. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The chronic nature of persistent depressive disorder, which produces serious life consequences that are often underestimated, justifies the combination of medication and psychotherapy. In the 2000 study, those in the combined treatment group had fewer dropouts than the medication-alone group due to adverse events (14% vs. 7%). There is some evidence that although benefits of psychotherapy are delayed, they continue even after psychotherapy is stopped. </li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comprehensive Treatment Plan with Shared Decision-Making</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Care Model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: A collaborative care approach is recommended for patients with depression in primary care. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Collaborative care model has demonstrated improvement in treatment adherence, patient quality of life and depression outcomes. It has demonstrated beneficial impact on direct and indirect economic benefits. Evidence suggests the collaborative care model is also effective for depression during pregnancy and postpartum period. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: There are challenges in providing the collaborative care model, such as identifying depressed patients, identifying care managers with the right experience and background, establishing the responsibilities and scope of practice of the care managers, whether to locate care managers in a clinic versus centrally based, determining the level of psychiatric supervision, seeking adequate reimbursement for services provider to ensure program sustainability, and feasibility of small clinics to employ on-site mental health specialists or full-time care managers. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Collaborative care has shown to improve patient outcomes and provider satisfaction while decreasing cost outweighing the challenges of implementing a collaborative care program. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Fortney et al., 2013; Archer et al., 2012; Katon &amp; Seelig, 2008; Gjerdingen &amp; Yawn, 2007; Belnap et al., 2006; Gilbody et al., 2006; Hunkeler et al., 2006; Simon et al., 2001; Katon et al., 1999. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Educate and Engage Patient</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Before initiating treatment, it is important to establish a therapeutic alliance with the patient regarding diagnosis and treatment options (in which there is overlap in the patient's and clinician's definition of the problem and agreement on which steps are to be taken by each). (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Therapeutic alliance is a potent predictor of treatment outcomes whether the treatment is psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Patient participation in shared decision-making improves adherence to treatment and clinical outcomes. When patients express a treatment preference, the use of that treatment, whether psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, predicts a positive outcome. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: A therapeutic alliance can take time to develop, and time is difficult to find in a busy clinical practice. If treatment is delayed because of an uncertain alliance or initiated before an alliance is attained, it could adversely affect outcomes. Difficult experiences with the treatment of depression may cause clinicians to avoid treating depressed patients. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefits of a therapeutic alliance in terms of improved patient outcomes more than offsets the investment of time. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Kocsis et al., "Patient," 2009; Loh et al., 2007; Krupnick et al., 1996. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-Up</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Establish Follow-Up Plan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Clinicians should establish and maintain follow-up with patients. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Appropriate, reliable follow-up is highly correlated with improved response and remission scores. It is also correlated with the improved safety and efficacy of medications and helps prevent relapse. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: Potential harms may include added expense and unnecessary visits. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Benefits appear to outweigh potential harms by a wide margin. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Trivedi et al., 2006; Un&uuml;tzer et al., 2002; Hunkeler et al., 2000; Simon et al., 2000. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pregnant and Postpartum Women</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Clinicians should screen and monitor depression in pregnant and postpartum women. (<strong>Quality of Evidence: Low; Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Untreated prenatal depression has been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes such as poor maternal self-care, poor nutrition, preterm labor and low birth weight, as well as negative effects on children such as developmental delay and cognitive impairment. There is low to moderate evidence that screening pregnant and post-partum women improves outcomes even in the absence of treatment protocols, care managers and specialty trained providers. The benefit is that by screening patients, one would be finding and treating many more patients with depression. </li>
    <li><strong>Harm</strong>: The only harm identified is the cost of screening patients who are not depressed. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Although direct evidence of the isolated health benefit of depression screening in primary care is weak, the totality of the evidence supports the benefits of screening in pregnant and postpartum women, particularly in the presence of additional treatment supports such as treatment protocols, care management, and availability of specially trained depression care providers. </li>

<p>A consistent and defined literature search process is used in the development and revision of Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) guidelines. Two literature searches were conducted for this guideline. The searches were conducted in PubMed, Ovid and PsycINFO.</p>
<p>The first search included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and observational studies from January 2013 to February 2015. The search was limited to adults over 18 years of age. The search excluded animal studies and non-English language studies. The terms included screening; patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); insomnia; therapeutic alliance in depressed patients; psychotherapies; antidepressants; implementation and best practices; special populations and disparities; telepsychiatry and outcomes; complementary medicine; integrated care, coordinated care, collaborative care; continuity of patient care, follow-up, office visits and frequency; effective treatments for adults with major depression who also have diabetes; prevalence and treatment of depression in patients who had stroke; after care; follow-up; remission; remission induction; functional impairment; cognitive impairment; genomics, genetics and pharmacogenetics; shared decision-making; and TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation).</p>
<p>The second literature search was specific to treatment recommendations for major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder and included systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. It covered the period between January 2005 and September 2015 and was limited to adults over 18 years of age. The search excluded animal studies and non-English language studies. The terms included treatment, treatment outcomes and multiple treatment comparison; psychological treatment and supportive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy; antidepressant agents, pharmacotherapy and drug therapy; combined treatment; duration of treatment, acute phase, continuation phase, maintenance phase; depression and major depression; dysthymia disorder and persistent depressive disorder, chronic depression and chronic major depression.</p>
<p>In addition to the literature searches, articles were obtained by work group members and ICSI staff. Those vetted by the work group were included in the guideline when appropriate.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document Development and Revision Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The development process is based on a number of long-proven approaches and is continually being revised based on changing community standards. The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) staff, in consultation with the work group and a medical librarian, conduct a literature search to identify systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, meta-analysis, other guidelines, regulatory statements and other pertinent literature. This literature is evaluated based on the GRADE methodology by work group members. When needed, an outside methodologist is consulted.</p>
<p>The work group uses this information to develop or revise clinical flows and algorithms, write recommendations, and identify gaps in the literature. The work group gives consideration to the importance of many issues as they develop the guideline. These considerations include the systems of care in our community and how resources vary, the balance between benefits and harms of interventions, patient and community values, the autonomy of clinicians and patients and more. All decisions made by the work group are done using a consensus process.</p>
<p>ICSI's medical group members and sponsors review each guideline as part of the revision process. They provide comment on the scientific content, recommendations and implementation strategies. This feedback is used by and responded to by the work group as part of their revision work. Final review and approval of the guideline is done by ICSI's Committee on Evidence-Based Practice. This committee is made up of practicing clinicians and nurses, drawn from ICSI member medical groups.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Recommendations and Measures</span></strong></p>
<p>These are provided to assist medical groups and others to implement the recommendations in the guidelines. Where possible, implementation strategies are included that have been formally evaluated and tested. Measures are included that may be used for quality improvement as well as for outcome reporting. When available, regulatory or publicly reported measures are included.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document Revision Cycle</span></strong></p>
<p>Scientific documents are revised as indicated by changes in clinical practice and literature. ICSI staff monitors major peer-reviewed journals for any pertinent evidence that would affect a particular guideline and recommendation.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness Impact of Collaborative Care Models</span></strong></p>
<p>In a collaborative care model, the primary treatment for depression is provided by a multidisciplinary team. Most studies have concluded that creating and implementing a collaborative care model will increase effectiveness &ndash; producing significant and sustained gains in "depression-free days." The six-month and one-year studies show increased cost to the outpatient care system. This is balanced by continuous accumulation of clinical and economic benefits over time. One of the factors is the decrease in the utilization of general medical services in patients with chronic medical comorbidities. The two-year studies show mixed results possibly indicating a turning point, and the only longer-term study conducted was the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) study. This was a well-done study analyzing the costs of performing collaborative care for one year over a four-year period. The study illustrated a cost savings of $3,363 per patient over the four-year period.</p>
<p>Almost all the studies done on this aspect have compared enhanced/collaborative care with care as usual. Typically, enhanced care has involved creating a list of depressed patients under treatment, having a care manager provide education, calling or meeting with patient periodically to ensure compliance with medications and/or psychotherapy, and reliably ensuring follow-up visits and measurement of outcomes. Some have involved varying participation of physicians, behavioral health professionals and/or patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Workplace Impact of Collaborative Care Models</span></strong></p>
<p>Randomized controlled trials looked at cost of doing enhanced care and specifically tallied decreases of "absenteeism" and improved work performance (which means that employees are present and effectively achieving good work results, sometimes referred to as decreasing "presenteeism"). Some studies monetized the results and compared them to usual care. The significance of these studies and this analysis is that in the United States, depression costs employers $24 billion in lost productive work time.</p>
<p>In two randomized controlled trials, employers received significant return on investment (ROI) from collaborative care treatment of depression by increasing productivity/decreasing absenteeism in the workplace. Increased productivity ranged from 2.6 hours to 5.6 hours per week after one year. Studies going out to two years showed continued gains in year two.</p>
<p>Several of the articles recommend consideration of coverage of collaborative care to ensure better patient outcomes and the ROI illustrated.</p></div></p>
