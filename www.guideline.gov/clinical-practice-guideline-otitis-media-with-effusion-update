<p>The clinician should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing otitis media with effusion (OME) in a child.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strong recommendation</span></em> based on systematic review of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 1b. Pneumatic Otoscopy</span></strong></p>
<p>The clinician should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strong recommendation</span></em> based on systematic review of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To improve diagnostic accuracy for OME with a readily available but underutilized means of assessing middle ear status (National Quality Strategy domain: clinical process/effectiveness) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic review of cross-sectional studies with a consistent reference standard </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Improve diagnostic certainty; reduce false-negative diagnoses caused by effusions that do not have obvious air bubbles or an air-fluid level; reduce false-positive diagnoses that lead to unnecessary tests and costs; readily available equipment; document mobility of the tympanic membrane; efficient; cost-effective </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Costs of training clinicians in pneumatic otoscopy; false-positive diagnoses from nonintact tympanic membrane; minor procedural discomfort </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Pneumatic otoscopy is underutilized for diagnosing OME, especially in primary care settings; accurate diagnosis of OME using pneumatic otoscopy is a prerequisite for managing children with OME </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Very limited </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 2. Tympanometry</span></strong> </p>
<p>Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strong recommendation</span></em> based on extrapolation of systematic reviews of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Improve diagnostic accuracy for OME and raise awareness regarding the value of tympanometry as an objective measure of middle ear status (National Quality Strategy domain: clinical process/effectiveness) </li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 3. Failed Newborn Hearing Screen</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn hearing screen regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a predominance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Increase adherence to follow-up and ensure that an underlying SNHL is not missed (National Quality Strategy domains: care coordination, patient and family engagement) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, indirect observational evidence on the benefits of longitudinal follow-up for effusions in newborn screening programs and the prevalence of SNHL in newborn screening failures with OME </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefit: More prompt diagnosis of SNHL; earlier intervention for hearing loss; reduce loss to follow-up; reassure parents </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Time spent in counseling; parental anxiety from increased focus on child hearing issues </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The method and specifics of follow-up are at the discretion of the clinician but should seek resolution of OME within 3 months of onset or, if not known, diagnosis </li>

    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 4a. Identifying At-risk Children</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors (see Table 3 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 4b. Evaluating At-risk Children</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should evaluate at-risk children (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time).</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Raise awareness of a subset of children with OME (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) who are disproportionately affected by middle ear effusion as compared with otherwise healthy children and to detect OME in at-risk children that might have been missed without explicit screening but could affect their developmental progress (National Quality Strategy domain: population/public health) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies regarding the high prevalence of OME in at-risk children and the known impact of hearing loss on child development; D, expert opinion on the ability of prompt diagnosis to alter outcomes </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefit: Identify at-risk children who might benefit from early intervention for OME (including tympanostomy tubes) and from more active and accurate surveillance of middle ear status; identify unsuspected OME and reduce the impact of OME and associated hearing loss on child development </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Direct costs of evaluating for OME (e.g., tympanometry), identifying self-limited effusions, parental anxiety, potential for overtreatment </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The guideline update group (GUG) assumed that at-risk children (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) are less likely to tolerate OME than would the otherwise healthy child and that persistent OME could limit the benefit of ongoing therapies and education interventions for at-risk children with special needs; assumption that early identification of OME in at-risk children could improve developmental outcomes </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The method of evaluating for OME is not specified but should follow recommendations in this guideline regarding pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry; an interval of 12 to 18 months is stated to give the clinician flexibility and to ensure that evaluation takes place at a critical time in the child's development </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 5. Screening Healthy Children</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort.</p>

    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited but a parent can request screening if desired </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The word "routine" is used to indicate that there may be specific circumstances where screening is appropriate&mdash;for example, a child with a strong family history of otitis media or a child who is suspected to be at risk but does not yet have a formal at-risk diagnosis </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation against </li>
    <li>Difference of opinions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 6. Patient Education</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Discourage medical therapy that does not affect long-term outcomes for OME (resolution, hearing levels [HLs], or need for tympanostomy tubes) but does have significant cost and potential adverse events (National Quality Strategy domain: patient safety, efficient use of health care resources). </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic review of well-designed RCTs </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoid side effects and reduce cost by not administering medications; avoid delays in definitive therapy caused by short-term improvement then relapse; avoid societal impact of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing on bacterial resistance and transmission of resistant pathogens </li>

    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Detection of structural changes in the tympanic membrane that may require intervention; detection of new hearing difficulties or symptoms that would lead to reassessing the need for intervention, including tympanostomy tubes; discussion of strategies for optimizing the listening-learning environment for children with OME; as well as ongoing counseling and education of parents/caregiver </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Cost of follow-up </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Although it is uncommon, untreated OME can cause progressive changes in the tympanic membrane that require surgical intervention. There was an implicit assumption that surveillance and early detection/intervention could prevent complications and would provide opportunities for ongoing education and counseling of caregivers </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The surveillance interval is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months to accommodate provider and patient preference; "significant" hearing loss is broadly defined as that noticed by the caregiver, reported by the child, or interfering with school performance or quality of life</li>

    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, systematic review of RCTs (tubes, adenoidectomy) and observational studies (adenoidectomy) </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium, because of limited data on long-term benefits of these interventions and heterogeneity among RCTs included in the systematic reviews </li>
    <li>Benefit: Promoting effective therapy; avoiding adenoidectomy in an age group where benefits have not been shown as a primary intervention for OME; benefits of surgery that include improved hearing reduced prevalence of OME, and less need for additional tympanostomy tube insertion (after adenoidectomy) </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Risks of anesthesia and specific surgical procedures, sequelae of tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomy </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Although some studies suggest benefits of adenoidectomy for children &lt;4 years old as primary therapy for OME, the data are inconsistent and relatively sparse; the additional surgical risks of adenoidectomy (e.g., velopharyngeal insufficiency, more complex anesthesia) were felt to outweigh the uncertain benefits in this group </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: For children aged &ge;4 years, the decision to offer tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both is based on shared decision making </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Moderate role in the choice of surgical procedure for children aged &ge;4 years (tubes, adenoidectomy, or both) </li>
    <li>Exceptions: Adenoidectomy may be contraindicated in children with cleft palate or syndromes associated with a risk of velopharyngeal insufficiency </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Difference of opinion: None </li>

<p>An information specialist conducted 2 systematic literature searches using a validated filter strategy to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the prior guideline (2004). Search terms used were "Otitis Media with Effusion"[Mesh] OR "otitis media with effusion"[tiab] OR (OME[tiab] AND otitis) OR "middle ear effusion"[tiab] OR "glue ear"[tiab]; otitis/exp OR otitis AND media AND (effusion/exp OR effusion); MH "Otitis Media with Effusion" OR TI (OME and effusion) OR TI "otitis media with effusion"; and (DE "OTITIS MEDIA") OR "otitis media with effusion" OR (OME AND otitis) OR "middle ear effusion" OR "glue ear." In certain instances, targeted searches for lower-level evidence were performed to address gaps from the systematic searches identified in writing the guideline. The original MEDLINE search was updated from January 2004 to January 2015 to include Medline, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and the Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>In developing this update of the evidence-based clinical practice guideline, the methods outlined in the third edition of the American Academy of Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guideline development manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) were followed explicitly.</p>
<p>The AAO-HNSF assembled a guideline update group (GUG) representing the disciplines of otolaryngology&ndash;head and neck surgery, pediatric otolaryngology, otology, pediatrics, allergy and immunology, family medicine, audiology, speech-language pathology, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. The GUG had several conference calls and one in-person meeting during which it defined the scope and objectives of updating the guideline, reviewed comments from the expert panel review for each key action statement, identified other quality improvement opportunities, and reviewed the literature search results.</p>
<p>The evidence profile for each statement in the earlier guideline was then converted into an expanded action statement profile for consistency with the AAO-HNSF's current development standards. Information was added to the action statement profiles regarding the quality improvement opportunity, level of confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, intentional vagueness, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. New key action statements were developed with an explicit and transparent <em>a priori</em> protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. Electronic decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) was used to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles.</p>
<p>The updated guideline underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, improve clarity of recommendations, and predict potential obstacles to implementation. The GUG received summary appraisals and modified an advanced draft of the guideline based on the appraisal.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing otitis media with effusion (OME). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible provider, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline update group (GUG) sought to minimize harm, diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy, and reduce the unnecessary use of systemic antibiotics. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The complete guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em>, and an executive summary will be simultaneously published in the main journal. A full-text version of the guideline will also be accessible free of charge at <a href="/web/20180712202234/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50109&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.entnet.org" title="AAO-HNSF Web site">www.entnet.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712202234im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>, the American Academy of Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) Web site. The guideline will be presented to AAO-HNSF members as a mini-seminar at the 2015 annual meeting. Existing brochures, publications, and patient information sheets from the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>Although pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were recommended for diagnosing otitis media with effusion (OME) in the first version of this guideline, pneumatic otoscopy in particular continues to be underused in primary care settings. The guideline update group (GUG) provides expanded information on both these diagnostic modalities in the new guideline, but enhanced efforts will still be needed in primary care settings to teach and promote accurate OME diagnosis. The degree to which specialists use pneumatic otoscopy has not been studied, but educational efforts would likely be of benefit to this population as well.</p>
<p>OME is one of the most common reasons that infants fail a newborn hearing test, but ensuring follow-up to assess for resolution of the effusion and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be challenging. AAO-HNSF provides counseling materials in this regard that clinicians can distribute to families of children with OME, but continued education of hospital providers who administer the newborn testing is an additional challenge. The GUG hopes that the new attention focused on this issue by the guideline will promote investigation and change in this area.</p>
<p>The new guideline reaffirms a prior recommendation against routine screening of children for OME but adds a new recommendation that clinicians evaluate at-risk children for OME when the at-risk condition is diagnosed and again at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time). This new recommendation imposes some additional burden on providers, in terms of both remembering to do the assessment and performing the actual evaluation for OME. The GUG showed strong consensus and support for this recommendation as a means to improve quality of care for at-risk children. Implementing this in practice will require continuing medical education strategies and integration into clinical decision support systems.</p>
<p>Whereas antibiotics and oral steroids are used infrequently to treat OME, there is a perception that topical intranasal steroids and antireflux medications are relatively common interventions, despite a lack of evidence for their efficacy. The GUG recommends explicitly against using these for a primary indication of OME, but reinforcement will be needed to implement this strategy, especially through performance measures. This is especially important to avoid costly, ineffective, and potentially harmful care.</p>
<p>Last, the GUG makes a new recommendation that adenoidectomy should not be done for a primary indication of OME in children &lt;4 years old. This contradicts established practice for many clinicians and some information in the prior guideline (e.g., offering adenoidectomy when repeat surgery is required for children &ge;2 years old). Continuing medical education will be needed to explicitly focus on the rationale for this change (e.g., new randomized trials and systematic reviews) to promote uptake in routine clinical practice.</p></div></p>

<p>The cost of developing this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed to not discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.</p>
