<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>Assessing the clinical effectiveness of the PCA3 assay and Prostate Health Index (PHI) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer involved three separate systematic reviews:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A review of the analytic validity of the intervention tests to assess how accurately the tests measure PCA3/PHI level present in a sample </li>
    <li>A review of the clinical validity (diagnostic test accuracy) of comparator and intervention pathways to assess how the addition of the PCA3 assay or PHI might contribute to the diagnosis of prostate cancer. </li>
    <li>A review of the clinical utility of the intervention test pathways to evaluate how the addition of the intervention tests might affect patient outcomes, including long-term outcomes such as mortality and morbidity from prostate cancer, and intermediate outcomes such as side effects from tests. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Search Strategy: Analytic Validity Review</strong></p>
<p><em>Electronic Databases</em></p>
<p>The following databases were searched on 28th April or 19th May 2014 for eligible studies:</p>

<p>No study design filters were applied and non-English language reports were excluded. All databases were searched from 2000. The following types of report were excluded:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Editorials, opinion pieces and correspondence on journal articles </li>
    <li>Conference abstracts </li>
</ul>
<p>Trial and research registers were searched on 24th July 2014 for ongoing trials and reviews including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

</ul>
<p>Details of the search strategies used can be found in Appendix 2 of the Assessment Report.</p>
<p><em>Searching Other Resources</em></p>
<p>Backward citation searching was undertaken on key review articles. As in all searches, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website was searched for the following terms: PCA3, PHI, and p2PSA.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Strategy: Analytic Validity Review</strong></p>
<p>Three reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts identified via searching and obtained full paper manuscripts that were considered relevant by any of the reviewers (Stage 1). The relevance of each study was assessed according to pre-specified inclusion criteria (Stage 2). Studies that did not meet the criteria were excluded. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.</p>
<p>The analytic validity review focused on studies that addressed the ability of the intervention test to accurately and reliably measure the target analyte. Inclusion criteria are presented in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Search Strategy and Study Selection Strategy: Clinical Validity Review</strong></p>
<p>The same search strategy and study selection strategy were used for the analytic validity and clinical validity reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria: Clinical Validity Review</strong></p>
<p>Comparisons between the performance of the intervention tests (PCA3 assay and PHI) and the comparison tests (clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) can be made using either data from studies carried out in the same study population (within-study or direct comparisons) or from data from studies where intervention and comparator tests are carried out in different populations (between-study or indirect comparisons). The preferred data for this review are derived from within-study comparisons of intervention and comparator test pathways.</p>
<p><em>Within-Study (Direct) Comparisons</em></p>
<p>Due to uncertainty about the diagnostic pathways used in National Health Service (NHS) clinical practice and the limited availability of MRI scanning facilities, the External Assessment Group (EAG) initially included all studies with a direct comparison of the PCA3 assay or PHI with any one or more of following component comparator tests:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Individual clinical risk factors such as age, digital rectal examinations (DRE) </li>
    <li>Standard clinical judgement/nomograms </li>
    <li>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels </li>
    <li>MRI results: T2-MRI/diffusion weighted (DW)-MRI </li>
</ul>
<p>As the intervention tests (PCA3 assay or PHI) can be used as replacement, add-on or triage tests to the comparator tests, studies that have directly compared the clinical validity of the PCA3 assay versus the clinical validity of PHI, with or without other comparators, were also included. The inclusion criteria used to select eligible within-study comparisons are presented in the Table below.</p>
<p><em>Systematic Reviews for Use in Between-study (Indirect) Comparisons</em></p>
<p>In the absence of any available within-study comparisons the EAG would have considered carrying out between-study (indirect) comparisons of the intervention tests versus comparator tests. Given the likely large number of studies evaluating each of the intervention and comparator tests, estimates of the clinical validity of the intervention and comparator tests from good quality systematic reviews with meta-analyses were sought to provide data for any between-study (indirect) comparisons undertaken. The inclusion criteria used to select eligible systematic reviews are presented in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Full details of the main search strategy conducted by the EAG are presented in the "Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness" above. The EAG did not use specific economics-related search terms in the main strategy as all of the potential references were scanned for studies containing economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Three reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts identified via searching and set aside the sub-set of records with the term "cost" or "economic" included in the title or abstract (Stage 1). At Stage 2, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the records that were potentially relevant to the cost-effectiveness review. Full paper manuscripts of any titles and abstracts that were considered relevant by either reviewer were obtained. The relevance of each study was then assessed according to the criteria set out in the table below. Studies that did not meet the criteria were excluded. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and, where necessary, a third reviewer was consulted.</p>

The remaining 103 records were assessed for eligibility and 99 were excluded as they did not include the relevant comparators or they did not consider an eligible study population. Full texts were obtained for four references. However, none of the four references met the study inclusion criteria and were, therefore, excluded from the systematic review.

<p><strong>Clinical Validity Review</strong></p>
<p><em>Data Extraction Strategy</em> </p>
<p>A paper-based data extraction form was created for the clinical validity review (see Appendix 3 of the Assessment Report). These forms were revised after data had been extracted from three studies. Three reviewers, who worked independently, extracted relevant data and the data-extraction forms were cross-checked. When more than one publication reported findings from a single study, a composite data form was created. In cases where reported data appeared to be missing or unclear, clarification was sought from study authors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Within-Study (Direct) Comparisons</span></p>
<p>Limited data (e.g., details relating to the comparator interventions, study population [including inclusion and exclusion criteria] and author conclusions) were extracted from studies that were eligible for inclusion but did not report data from a clinically relevant comparison, i.e., limited data were extracted from studies that reported the results of univariate PCA3 or univariate Prostate Health Index (PHI) versus univariate prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</p>
<p>Complete data were extracted from all other eligible studies. Particular attention was paid to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>How the intervention and comparator tests were used (replacement, add-on, triage or not stated) </li>
    <li>Definition of positive biopsy, including grade and stage of tumour detected </li>
    <li>Threshold values used for intervention tests </li>
</ul>
<p>The available data on all reported clinical validity outcomes were recorded including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>2x2 tables of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) values </li>
    <li>Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios </li>
    <li>Area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity values derived from receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves </li>

<p>Study extraction was limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Details relating to the comparator interventions </li>
    <li>Study population (including inclusion and exclusion criteria) </li>
    <li>Number of studies and participants included in meta-analyses </li>
    <li>Author conclusions </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Quality Assessment Strategy</em></p>
<p>Quality assessment was not undertaken for studies which were eligible for inclusion but did not report data from a clinically relevant comparison. Quality assessment was not undertaken for systematic reviews for use in between-study comparisons as only the conclusions from these papers were included in the review.</p>
<p>The QUADAS-2, a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, was used to assess the quality of included studies. This tool considers four domains: patient selection; index tests and comparator tests; reference standard; flow and timing. These domains were assessed both for risk of bias (whether the conduct or design of the study led to a distortion of results) and for applicability issues (whether the study reflected the population and tests used in practice). The tool content was tailored to meet the requirements for this review and a copy of the tool is displayed in Appendix 3 of the Assessment Report. </p>
<p>See Section 4.3.4 of the Assessment Report for information on issues that were of particular importance to this review.</p>
<p><em>Methods of Data Analysis/Synthesis</em></p>
<p>Extracted data, grouped by type of outcome, were tabulated for each comparison. Measures of difference between the comparator test pathways were calculated for the following measures:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Comparison of AUC </li>
    <li>Sensitivity at set values of specificity </li>
    <li>Specificity at set values of sensitivity </li>
</ul>
<p>Odds ratios from multivariate logistic regression analyses were recorded as a measure of the independence of the effect of the intervention tests.</p>
<p>The following sensitivity analyses were considered:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Type of second biopsy (saturation, template or guided) </li>
    <li>Threshold value used for intervention test </li>
    <li>Different risk groups (grades or stages) of tumour detected by the second biopsy </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The External Assessment Group's (EAG's) <em>de novo</em> economic model uses the derived specificities for stated sensitivity levels.</p>
<p><strong>Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>A schematic of the diagnostic strategy used in the model is shown in Figure 5 in the Assessment Report. Following an initial negative biopsy, clinical assessment alone, or results from an alternative diagnostic strategy are used by the clinician to decide whether or not to recommend a second biopsy.</p>
<p>An economic model was produced which explored the use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy in men with suspected prostate cancer. The EAG has assumed that all patients who are recommended for a second biopsy choose to have a biopsy and all those for whom a second biopsy is not recommended do not demand one. Patients having a biopsy may experience a short-term deterioration in quality of life (QoL); in addition, biopsies may result in complications.</p>
<p>In the base case, the EAG has adopted the assumption used in the Mowatt model, i.e., that patients with undiagnosed cancer, either with or without a second biopsy, will continue to have elevated PSA levels. In addition, the EAG has assumed that 25% of men without cancer will also continue to have a rising PSA level and that, at 1, 2 and 3 years respectively, 25%, 50% and 100% of patients with a rising PSA level will have a saturation biopsy. The EAG has included sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of 0%, 25%, 50% and 75% of men with a negative second biopsy entering PSA monitoring.</p>
<p>In addition, the following two scenario analyses have been undertaken by the EAG:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The monitoring and second biopsy strategy used in the CG175 (Cancer Research UK, 2014) magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) model </li>
    <li>The monitoring strategy used in the Mowatt model </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Time Horizon</em></p>
<p>As a PSA monitoring strategy can run for several years, the time horizon of the model is limited to the time that patients spend within any such strategy. The monitoring strategy is independent of the diagnostic strategies assessed in the model, so unless there is a lifetime PSA monitoring strategy the model does not require a lifetime horizon. In the base case, the PSA monitoring strategy runs for 3 years so the time horizon is also 3 years. The time horizons for the scenario analyses exploring the impact of the PSA monitoring strategies used in the CG175 MRI model and the Mowatt model are 6 years and 1 year respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, the following two scenario analyses were undertaken by the EAG:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The monitoring and second biopsy strategy used in the CG175 MRI model </li>
    <li>The monitoring strategy used in the Mowatt model </li>
</ul>
<p>These two scenarios can be considered to represent the "least costly" (Mowatt) and "most costly" (CG175 MRI model) PSA monitoring scenarios.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developing Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>After reviewing the evidence the Diagnostics Advisory Committee (DAC) agrees draft recommendations on the use of the technology in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. When formulating these recommendations, the Committee has discretion to consider those factors it believes are most appropriate to the evaluation. In doing so, the Committee has regard to any relevant provisions of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Directions, set out by the Secretary of State for Health, and legislation on human rights, discrimination and equality. In undertaking evaluations of healthcare technologies, NICE takes into account the broad balance of clinical benefits and costs, the degree of clinical need of patients under consideration, any guidance issued to the NHS by the Secretary of State that is specifically drawn to the attention of NICE by the Secretary of State, and any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, and the potential for long-term benefits to the NHS of innovation.</p>
<p>The Committee takes into account advice from NICE on the approach it should take to making scientific and social value judgements. Advice on social value judgements is informed in part by the work of NICE's Citizens Council.</p>
<p>The Committee takes into account how its judgements have a bearing on distributive justice or legal requirements in relation to human rights, discrimination and equality. Such characteristics include, but are not confined to: race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender reassignment and pregnancy or maternity.</p>
<p>The Committee considers the application of other Board-approved NICE methods policies, such as the supplementary guidance on discounting and the end-of-life criteria, if they are relevant to the evaluation.</p>
<p>Because the Programme often evaluates new technologies that have a thin evidence base, in formulating its recommendations the Committee balances the quality and quantity of evidence with the expected value of the technology to the NHS and the public.</p>
<p>The credibility of the guidance produced by NICE depends on the transparency of the DAC's decision-making process. It is crucial that the DAC's decisions are explained clearly, and that the contributions of registered stakeholders and the views of members of the public are considered. The reasoning behind the Committee's recommendations is explained, with reference to the factors that have been taken into account.</p>
<p>The language and style used in the documents produced by the Committee are governed by the following principles:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clarity is essential in explaining how the DAC has come to its conclusions. </li>
    <li>The text of the documents does not need to reiterate all the factual information that can be found in the information published alongside the guidance. This needs careful judgement so that enough information and justification is given in the recommendations to enable the reader to understand what evidence the DAC considered and, if appropriate, who provided that evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Committee may take into account factors that may provide benefits to the NHS or the population, such as patient convenience. It may also consider costs and other positive or negative impacts on the NHS that may not be captured in the reference-case cost analysis, such as improved processes.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Not applicable</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Cost Analysis</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The base-case analysis compared the number of biopsies needed, the disutility (quality-adjusted life years [QALY] loss) and costs of each of the diagnostic strategies. Adding the Prostate Health Index (PHI) or the PCA3 assay to clinical assessment produced a small increase in total biopsies compared with clinical assessment. This was accompanied by an increase in costs and a slight loss of utility compared with clinical assessment. Adding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to clinical assessment strategy reduced the number of biopsies needed from 1099 for clinical assessment to 520. This was a more costly strategy than clinical assessment, but resulted in a lower disutility. Strategies that included clinical assessment with MRI and either the PCA3 assay or the PHI were more costly and had only a slight effect on the number of QALYs lost.</p>
<p>The incremental analysis shows that all diagnostic strategies are dominated by clinical assessment, with the exceptions of clinical assessment plus MRI and clinical assessment plus MRI plus the PHI. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for clinical assessment with MRI was &pound;33,911 per QALY and &pound;2,500,530 per QALY for clinical assessment with MRI and the PHI. Both strategies exceed the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) maximum acceptable ICER of &pound;30,000 per QALY gained.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deterministic Sensitivity Analyses</span></strong></p>
<p>Deterministic sensitivity analysis tested the impact of using assumptions from other data sources. Assumptions from two studies were included in these analyses. Clinical assessment together with the PCA3 assay was the only nondominated strategy, but the ICERs per QALY gained were &pound;59,732 (80% sensitivity), &pound;963,964 (90%), and &pound;105,765 (90%). Sensitivity analysis also included increasing the rate of complications to the upper level suggested in the literature, reducing the cost of the PHI by 50%, increasing the upper level of the QALY loss from biopsy to the upper limit in the literature, assuming that 50% of cancers are missed on second biopsy and varying the proportion of patients with negative second biopsies entering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring. The costs of biopsy complications were also increased by 100%. The ICERs were stable to these changes; strategies involving the PHI or the PCA3 assay were dominated by clinical assessment, with the exception of clinical assessment together with MRI and the PHI. However, the ICERs for this strategy ranged from &pound;1,213,727 to &pound;2,500,530 per QALY gained compared with clinical assessment alone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses</span></strong></p>
<p>Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out using the base-case evidence and assumptions and the alternative evidence sources and sensitivity rates. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for the base-case analysis shows that the most cost-effective strategy, at &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, is clinical assessment in 100% of model iterations. At a maximum acceptable ICER of &pound;33,500 per QALY gained, approximately half of the iterations suggest that clinical assessment is the most cost-effective strategy. The remaining iterations suggest that clinical assessment with MRI is the most cost-effective strategy. At a maximum acceptable ICER of &pound;37,000 per QALY gained, all iterations suggest that clinical assessment with MRI dominates (that is, is less expensive and more effective than) all other strategies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the results of the base-case analysis. They noted that the Diagnostic Assessment Report (DAR) indicated that, at a set sensitivity level of 90%, all diagnostic strategies were dominated by clinical assessment (that is, clinical assessment was less expensive and more effective), apart from clinical assessment with MRI with an ICER of &pound;33,911 per QALY gained, and clinical assessment with MRI and the PHI with an ICER of &pound;2,500,530 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that the ICERs for all diagnostic strategies involving either the PCA3 assay or the PHI were high and lay outside the range that NICE would normally consider as cost effective. The tests were therefore unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources.</p>
