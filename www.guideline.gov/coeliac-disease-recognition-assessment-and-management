                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the Internal Clinical Guidelines Team on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recognition of Coeliac Disease</span></strong></p>
<p>Offer serological testing for coeliac disease to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>People with any of the following:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Persistent unexplained abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms </li>
        <li>Faltering growth </li>
        <li>Prolonged fatigue </li>
        <li>Unexpected weight loss </li>
        <li>Severe or persistent mouth ulcers </li>
        <li>Unexplained iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency </li>
        <li>Type 1 diabetes, at diagnosis </li>
        <li>Autoimmune thyroid disease, at diagnosis </li>
        <li>Irritable bowel syndrome (in adults) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>First-degree relatives of people with coeliac disease </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider serological testing for coeliac disease in people with any of the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Metabolic bone disorder (reduced bone mineral density or osteomalacia) </li>
    <li>Unexplained neurological symptoms (particularly peripheral neuropathy or ataxia) </li>
    <li>Unexplained subfertility or recurrent miscarriage </li>
    <li>Persistently raised liver enzymes with unknown cause </li>
    <li>Dental enamel defects </li>
    <li>Down's syndrome </li>
    <li>Turner syndrome </li>
</ul>
<p>For people undergoing investigations for coeliac disease:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Explain that any test is accurate only if a gluten-containing diet is eaten during the diagnostic process <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Advise the person not to start a gluten-free diet until diagnosis is confirmed by a specialist, even if the results of a serological test are positive </li>
</ul>
<p>Advise people who are following a normal diet (containing gluten) to eat some gluten in more than 1 meal every day for at least 6 weeks before testing.</p>
<p>If people who have restricted their gluten intake or excluded gluten from their diet are reluctant or unable to re-introduce gluten into their diet before testing:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Refer the person to a gastrointestinal specialist <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Explain that it may be difficult to confirm their diagnosis by intestinal biopsy </li>
</ul>
<p>Advise people who have tested negative for coeliac disease, particularly first-degree relatives and people with type 1 diabetes, that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Coeliac disease may present with a wide range of symptoms <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>They should consult their healthcare professional if any of the symptoms listed in the recommendations above arise or persist </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not offer serological testing for coeliac disease in infants before gluten has been introduced into the diet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Serological Testing for Coeliac Disease</span></strong></p>
<p>All serological tests should be undertaken in laboratories with clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) or ISO15189 accreditation.</p>
<p>When healthcare professionals request serological tests to investigate suspected coeliac disease in young people and adults, laboratories should:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Test for total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) as the first choice </li>
    <li>Use IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) if IgA tTG is weakly positive </li>
    <li>Consider using IgG EMA, IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) or IgG tTG if IgA is deficient (IgA deficiency is defined as total IgA less than 0.07 mg per litre) </li>
</ul>
<p>When healthcare professionals request serological tests to investigate suspected coeliac disease in children, laboratories should:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Test for total IgA and IgA tTG as the first choice </li>
    <li>Consider using IgG EMA, IgG DGP or IgG tTG if IgA is deficient </li>
</ul>
<p>When laboratories test for total IgA, a specific assay designed to measure total IgA levels should be used.</p>
<p>Do not use human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 (DQ2.2 and DQ2.5)/DQ8 testing in the initial diagnosis of coeliac disease in non-specialist settings.</p>
<p>Only consider using HLA DQ2 (DQ2.2 and DQ2.5)/DQ8 testing in the diagnosis of coeliac disease in specialist settings (for example, in children who are not having a biopsy, or in people who already have limited gluten ingestion and choose not to have a gluten challenge).</p>
<p>Laboratories should clearly communicate the interpretation of serological test results and recommended action to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral of People with Suspected Coeliac Disease</span></strong></p>
<p>Refer young people and adults with positive serological test results to a gastrointestinal specialist for endoscopic intestinal biopsy to confirm or exclude coeliac disease. (In young people and adults, a positive serological test result is defined as unambiguously positive IgA tTG alone, or weakly positive IgA tTG and a positive IgA EMA test result. Note: In people who have IgA deficiency, a serologically positive result can be derived from any one of the IgG antibodies.)</p>
<p>Refer children with positive serological test results to a paediatric gastroenterologist or paediatrician with a specialist interest in gastroenterology for further investigation for coeliac disease. (Further investigation may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: an IgA EMA test to confirm serological positivity, HLA genetic testing, an endoscopic biopsy.)</p>
<p>Refer people with negative serological test results to a gastrointestinal specialist for further assessment if coeliac disease is still clinically suspected.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should have a low threshold for re-testing people identified in the recommendations above if they develop any symptoms consistent with coeliac disease.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitoring in People with Coeliac Disease</span></strong></p>
<p>Consider referring people with coeliac disease for endoscopic intestinal biopsy if continued exposure to gluten has been excluded and:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Serological titres are persistently high and show little or no change after 12 months <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>They have persistent symptoms, including diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue or unexplained anaemia </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use serological testing alone to determine whether gluten has been excluded from the person's diet.</p>
<p>Offer an annual review to people with coeliac disease. During the review:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Measure weight and height </li>
    <li>Review symptoms </li>
    <li>Consider the need for assessment of diet and adherence to the gluten-free diet </li>
    <li>Consider the need for specialist dietetic and nutritional advice </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer the person to a general practitioner (GP) or consultant if concerns are raised in the annual review. The GP or consultant should assess all of the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The need for a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan (in line with the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/web/20180712202257/https://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=38410" title="Guideline #9309" target="_blank">Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture</a>) or active treatment of bone disease </li>
    <li>The need for specific blood tests </li>
    <li>The risk of long-term complications and comorbidities </li>
    <li>The need for specialist referral </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-responsive and Refractory Coeliac Disease</span></strong></p>
<p>Consider the following actions in people with coeliac disease who have persistent symptoms despite advice to exclude gluten from their diet:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Review the certainty of the original diagnosis </li>
    <li>Refer the person to a specialist dietitian to investigate continued exposure to gluten </li>
    <li>Investigate potential complications or coexisting conditions that may be causing persistent symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, microscopic colitis or inflammatory colitis </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnose refractory coeliac disease if the original diagnosis of coeliac disease has been confirmed, and exposure to gluten and any coexisting conditions have been excluded as the cause of continuing symptoms.</p>
<p>Refer people with refractory coeliac disease to a specialist centre for further investigation.</p>
<p>Consider prednisolone for the initial management of the symptoms of refractory coeliac disease in adults while waiting for specialist advice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information and Support</span></strong></p>
<p>Explain to people who are thought to be at risk of coeliac disease that a delayed diagnosis, or undiagnosed coeliac disease, can result in continuing ill health and serious long-term complications.</p>
<p>Give people with coeliac disease (and their family members or carers, where appropriate) sources of information on the disease, including national and local specialist coeliac groups and dietitians with a specialist knowledge in coeliac disease.</p>
<p>A healthcare professional with a specialist knowledge of coeliac disease should tell people with a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease (and their family members or carers, where appropriate) about the importance of a gluten-free diet and give them information to help them follow it. This should include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Information on which types of food contain gluten and suitable alternatives, including gluten-free substitutes </li>
    <li>Explanations of food labelling </li>
    <li>Information sources about gluten-free diets, recipe ideas and cookbooks </li>
    <li>How to manage social situations, eating out and travelling away from home, including travel abroad </li>
    <li>Avoiding cross contamination in the home and minimising the risk of accidental gluten intake when eating out </li>
    <li>The role of national and local coeliac support groups </li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that people with coeliac disease may experience anxiety and depression. Diagnose and manage these issues in line with the following NICE guidelines:</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advice on Dietary Management</span></strong></p>
<p>Advise people with coeliac disease (and their family members or carers, where appropriate) to seek advice from a member of their healthcare team if they are thinking about taking over-the-counter vitamin or mineral supplements.</p>
<p>Explain to people with coeliac disease (and their family members or carers, where appropriate) that they may need to take specific supplements such as calcium or vitamin D if their dietary intake is insufficient.</p>
<p>Explain to people with coeliac disease (and their family members or carers, where appropriate) that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>They can choose to include gluten-free oats in their diet at any stage <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>They will be advised whether to continue eating gluten-free oats depending on their immunological, clinical or histological response </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GDG usually use 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') when confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Could Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the Internal Clinical Guidelines Team on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developing Review Questions and Protocols and Identifying Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The technical team drafted review questions which were refined and validated by the Guideline Development Group (GDG), using a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework, and drafted review protocols based on the topics agreed with the stakeholders and included in the scope (see Appendix B in the full guideline appendices [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) and prepared a protocol for each review question (see Appendix C in the full guideline appendices). These formed the starting point for systematic reviews of relevant evidence. Published evidence was identified by applying systematic search strategies (see Appendix C in the full guideline appendices) to the following databases: Medline (1950 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 onwards), and three Cochrane databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects). Searches to identify economic studies were undertaken using the above databases, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database.</p>
<p>Where a question was updated directly from the previous guideline (CG68) the search strategies used in the CG68 were updated. However for the review question on signs and symptoms, coexisting conditions and first-degree relatives and long-term consequences, the GDG requested some new search for additional terms and these additional searches had no date restriction. No date restrictions were placed on the searches for all new questions.</p>
<p>Searches in EMBASE and Medline were limited to English language and studies in humans. None of the other searches were limited by language of publication (although publications in languages other than English were not reviewed). Validated search filters were used to identify particular study designs, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs). There was no systematic attempt to search grey literature (conference abstracts, theses or unpublished trials), nor was hand searching undertaken of journals not indexed on the databases.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the guideline development process, the searches were updated and re-executed to include evidence published and indexed in the databases by 5th December 2014.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Identification</span></strong></p>
<p>Identified titles and abstracts were sifted for relevance and data were extracted by 1 reviewer. A second reviewer checked a random 10% of sifted out titles and abstracts, and all excluded studies with the reason for exclusion, and all data extracted for the included studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Economics</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature reviews seeking to identify published cost&ndash;utility analyses of relevance to the issues under consideration were conducted for all questions, with the exception of those detailed in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 (which provided data for the health economic question considered in Section 4.4) and 7.1 and 7.2 in the full version of the guideline (which were information questions without a substantive health economic component). In each case, the search undertaken for the clinical review was modified, retaining population and intervention descriptors, but removing any study-design filter and adding a filter designed to identify relevant health economic analyses. Search strategies are provided in full in Appendix C in the full guideline appendices. In assessing studies for inclusion, population, intervention and comparator criteria were always identical to those used in the parallel clinical search; only cost&ndash;utility analyses were included.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the Internal Clinical Guidelines Team on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>The outcomes prioritised in the review questions and protocols reflect the treatment objectives outlined in each question. The minimum important difference (MID) for both dichotomous and continuous outcomes would be decided by looking at appropriate published evidence or under agreement with the Guideline Development Group (GDG) following discussion within committee meetings. On the occasion that no published literature on the minimal important difference was identified and the GDG were unable to specify on a default option was used, for example, in the case of dichotomous outcomes was defined as a relative risk reduction or an increase of 25% or more to be considered clinically important.</p>
<p>For this guideline, the effectiveness of interventions/diagnostic strategies to manage coeliac disease has been assessed against a variety of outcomes. The justification for using these outcomes is based on their relevance to people with the condition and the expert consensus opinion of members of the multidisciplinary GDG. When assessing the effectiveness of a particular treatment, information about the effect of that treatment on one or more primary outcomes was sought.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Basic characteristics of each included study were summarised into standardised evidence tables for each review question (see Appendix D in the full guideline appendices [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) along with the quality assessment of the evidence. Where outcome data were presented, results were entered as reported in the full-text report of the study.</p>
<p>Some studies were excluded from the guideline reviews after obtaining copies of the publications because they did not meet inclusion criteria specified by the GDG (see Appendix C in the full guideline appendices). These studies are listed in alphabetical order for each question and the reason for exclusion provided for each one.</p>
<p><em>Missing Continuous Data</em></p>
<p>Where the standard deviation of the mean change from baseline was not reported, the GDG imputed this using either the baseline standard deviation (SD) from the control group or the SD from a similar group.</p>
<p>When the standard deviation of the point estimate at study end was not reported, the GDG imputed this using either the baseline SD from the control group or the SD from a similar group.</p>
<p><em>Missing Dichotomous Data</em></p>
<p>Where the raw numbers for an outcome were not reported and a percentage was reported, the raw numbers were calculated manually from the reported percentage. When a decimal was calculated the number was rounded up if the decimal was over 0.5 and down if below 0.5.</p>
<p>When the outcome is negative (for example, adverse effects or failure rate) the denominator used equalled the total number of the study arm. When the outcome is positive (for example, effectiveness) the denominator used was the number completing in the study arm.</p>
<p><em>Quality Assessment Checklists</em></p>
<p>For randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the NICE methodological checklist for RCTs was used for quality assessment of the evidence. For cohort studies, the NICE methodological checklist for cohort study was used for quality assessment. For diagnostic studies, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) checklist was used for quality assessment. For qualitative studies, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative research design was used for quality assessment. For prognostic studies, a prognostic study checklist designed by Hayden and colleagues was used.</p>
<p><strong>Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted to combine the results of studies for each outcome. For continuous outcomes, where change from baseline data were reported in the trials and were accompanied by a measure of spread (for example standard deviation), these were extracted and used in the meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Dichotomous outcomes were presented as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous outcomes were presented as mean differences with 95% CIs or SDs.</p>
<p><em>Software</em></p>
<p>Data for intervention reviews were analysed using Review Manager 5.1 while data for diagnostic reviews was analysed using Meta Disk. An online calculator (<a href="/web/20180712202257/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49592&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fvassarstats.net" title="VassarStats Web site">http://vassarstats.net</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712202257im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>) was used to calculate confidence intervals around proportions for single studies.</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Process</strong></p>
<p>The body of evidence identified for each therapy or treatment review question (or part of a review question) was presented in the form of a GRADE evidence profile summarising the quality of the evidence and the findings (pooled relative and absolute effect sizes and associated CIs). Where possible, the body of evidence corresponding to each outcome specified in the review protocol was subjected to quantitative meta-analysis. In such cases, pooled effect sizes were presented as pooled RRs, pooled odds ratios (ORs), or mean differences. A random-effects model was used as default.</p>
<p>Where quantitative meta-analysis could not be undertaken, the range of effect sizes reported in the included studies was presented in a GRADE profile.</p>
<p>GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the selected outcomes as specified in 'The guidelines manual (2012)' (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The type of review question determines the highest level of evidence that may be sought. For issues of therapy or treatment, the highest possible evidence level is a well conducted systematic review or meta-analysis of RCTs, or an individual RCT. In the GRADE approach, a body of evidence based on RCTs has an initial quality rating of high, but this may be downgraded to moderate, low or very low if the factors listed above are not addressed adequately. For diagnostic review questions on prognosis, the highest possible level of evidence is a controlled observational study (a cohort study or case&ndash;control study), and a body of evidence based on such studies would have an initial quality rating of low, which might be downgraded to very low or upgraded to moderate or high, depending on the factors listed above.</p>
<p>For each review question the highest available level of evidence was sought. Where appropriate, for example, if a systematic review, meta-analysis or RCT was identified to answer a question directly, studies of a weaker design were not considered. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses and RCTs were not identified, other appropriate experimental or observational studies were sought.</p>
<p><em>GRADE Profiles for Interventional Evidence</em></p>
<p>The quality ratings for each study are reported the study's evidence table and are summarised in the footnotes of each GRADE profile. For this guideline, the GDG inserted footnotes to explain the choice made while assessing the quality of evidence for each outcomes. These footnotes indicated if the GDG upgraded the evidence level, downgraded the evidence level or left the evidence level unchanged, and gave the rationale for doing this.</p>
<p>The quality of the evidence for each outcome was downgraded where appropriate for the reasons outlined in Table 1 in the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p><em>Modified GRADE for Diagnostic Evidence</em></p>
<p>GRADE has not been developed for use with diagnostic studies; therefore a modified approach was applied using the GRADE framework.</p>
<p>Cohort studies within the GRADE approach start at the low quality level due to accepted inherent study design limitations. Within a modified approach, where evidence from cohort studies has been deemed to be the most appropriate source of information to answer a given review question, studies start from a presumption of 'high quality' The same criteria (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness) were used to downgrade the quality of evidence as detailed in Table 2 in the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p><em>Modified GRADE for Qualitative Studies</em></p>
<p>GRADE has not been developed for use with qualitative studies; therefore a modified approach was applied using the GRADE framework.</p>
<p>Qualitative studies within the non-modified GRADE approach start at the very low quality level due to accepted inherent study design limitations. Within a modified approach where qualitative evidence has been deemed to be the most appropriate source of information to answer a given review question, it is acceptable to initially indicate a high quality level to this study type and to assess the quality of evidence from this point. The same criteria (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness) were used to downgrade the quality of evidence as detailed in Table 3 in the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Health Economics</strong></span></p>
<p>Economic evidence profiles, including critical appraisal according to the Guidelines manual, were completed for included studies; these are shown in Appendix G in the full guideline appendices.</p>
<p>Economic studies identified through a systematic search of the literature are appraised using a methodology checklist designed for economic evaluations. This checklist is not intended to judge the quality of a study per se, but to determine whether an existing economic evaluation is useful to inform the decision-making of the GDG for a specific topic within the guideline. There are two parts of the appraisal process; the first step is to assess applicability (i.e., the relevance of the study to the specific guideline topic and the NICE reference case) (see Table 4 in the full version of the guideline).</p>
<p>In the second step, only those studies deemed directly or partially applicable are further assessed for limitations (i.e., the methodological quality, see Table 5 in the full version of the guideline).</p>
<p>Where relevant, a summary of the main findings from the systematic search, review and appraisal of economic evidence is presented in an economic evidence profile alongside the clinical evidence.</p>
<p>Original health economic modelling was conducted for 3 questions that were prioritised by the GDG for detailed analysis: order and sequencing of serological tests (see Section 5.2 in the full version of the guideline), active case-finding (see Section 4.4 in the full version of the guideline) and dietetic involvement in follow-up (considered as part of the review on frequency of follow-up; see Section 5.4 in the full version of the guideline). Each analysis relied on broadly the same model, which was originally developed for the serological testing question and subsequently modified to address other questions. Full details of the methods of the models are provided in Appendix G in the full guideline appendices.</p>
<p>In questions for which no published evidence was identified and original analysis was not prioritised, the GDG made a qualitative judgement about cost-effectiveness by considering potential differences in resource use and cost between the options alongside the results of the review of evidence of clinical effectiveness.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the Internal Clinical Guidelines Team on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agreeing the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>For each review question, recommendations for clinical care were derived using, and linked explicitly to, the evidence that supported them. In the first instance, informal consensus methods were used by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) to agree short clinical and, where appropriate, cost effectiveness evidence statements, which were presented alongside the evidence profiles. Statements summarising the GDG's interpretation of the evidence and any extrapolation from the evidence used to form recommendations were also prepared to ensure transparency in the decision-making process. The 'Linking evidence to recommendations' (LETR) criteria used in moving from evidence to recommendations were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Relative value placed on the outcomes considered </li>
    <li>Consideration of the clinical benefits and harms </li>
    <li>Consideration of net health benefits and resource use </li>
    <li>Quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Other considerations (including equalities issues) </li>
</ul>
<p>In areas where no substantial clinical research evidence was identified, the GDG considered other evidence-based guidelines and consensus statements or used their collective experience to identify good practice. The health economics justification in areas of the guideline where the use of National Health Service (NHS) resources (interventions) was considered was based on GDG consensus in relation to the likely cost-effectiveness implications of the recommendations. The GDG also identified areas where evidence to answer their review questions was lacking and used this information to formulate recommendations for future research.</p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendations were made. Some recommendations were made with more certainty than others. Recommendations are based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, whilst taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence.</p>
<p>For all recommendations, it is expected that a discussion will take place with the patients about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion should help the patient reach a fully informed decision. Terms used within this guideline are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>'Offer' &ndash; for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm </li>
    <li>'Do not offer' &ndash; the intervention will not be of benefit for most patients </li>
    <li>'Consider' &ndash; the benefit is less certain, and an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for an 'offer' recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient </li>
</ul>
<p>Towards the end of the guideline development process, formal consensus methods were used to consider all the clinical care recommendations and research recommendations that had been drafted previously.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') when confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The original health economic modelling the Guideline Development Group (GDG) undertook for this guideline addressed 3 topics: active case-finding in populations at increased risk of coeliac disease (see Section 4.4 in the full version of the guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), serological diagnosis of coeliac disease (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2 in the full version of the guideline) and dietitian-led follow-up of people with coeliac disease (see Section 5.4 in the full version of the guideline). Because modelling for active case-finding and dietitian-led follow-up was based on modified versions of the model developed for serological diagnosis, questions are presented out of guideline order.

        <li>Autoimmune thyroid disease, at diagnosis </li>
        <li>Irritable bowel syndrome (in adults) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>First-degree relatives of people with coeliac disease </li>
</ul>
<p>For people undergoing investigations for coeliac disease:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Explain that any test is accurate only if a gluten-containing diet is eaten during the diagnostic process <strong>and</strong> </li>
    <li>Advise the person not to start a gluten-free diet until diagnosis is confirmed by a specialist, even if the results of a serological test are positive </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Serological Testing for Coeliac Disease</strong></p>
<p>When healthcare professionals request serological tests to investigate suspected coeliac disease in young people and adults, laboratories should:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Test for total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) as the first choice </li>
    <li>Use IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) if IgA tTG is weakly positive </li>
    <li>Consider using IgG EMA, IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) or IgG tTG if IgA is deficient (IgA deficiency is defined as total IgA less than 0.07 mg per litre)</li>
</ul>
<p>When healthcare professionals request serological tests to investigate suspected coeliac disease in children, laboratories should:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Test for total IgA and IgA tTG, as the first choice </li>
    <li>Consider using IgG EMA, IgG DGP or IgG tTG if IgA is deficient </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring in People with Coeliac Disease</strong></p>
<p>Offer an annual review to people with coeliac disease. During the review:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Measure weight and height </li>
    <li>Review symptoms </li>
    <li>Consider the need for assessment of diet and adherence to the gluten-free diet </li>
    <li>Consider the need for specialist dietetic and nutritional advice </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-responsive and Refractory Coeliac Disease</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following actions in people with coeliac disease who have persistent symptoms despite advice to exclude gluten from their diet:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Review the certainty of the original diagnosis </li>
    <li>Refer the person to a specialist dietitian to investigate continued exposure to gluten </li>
    <li>Investigate potential complications or coexisting conditions that may be causing persistent symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, microscopic colitis or inflammatory colitis </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information and Support</strong></p>
<p>A healthcare professional with a specialist knowledge of coeliac disease should tell people with a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease (and their family members or carers, where appropriate) about the importance of a gluten-free diet and give them information to help them follow it. This should include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Information on which types of food contain gluten and suitable alternatives, including gluten-free substitutes </li>
    <li>Explanations of food labelling </li>
    <li>Information sources about gluten-free diets, recipe ideas and cookbooks </li>
    <li>How to manage social situations, eating out and travelling away from home, including travel abroad </li>
    <li>Avoiding cross-contamination in the home and minimising the risk of accidental gluten intake when eating out </li>
    <li>The role of national and local coeliac support groups </li>
</ul></div></p>
