                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by British Medical Journal Technology Assessment Group (BMJ-TAG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Description and Discussion of Appropriateness of Manufacturer's Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer's submission (MS) describes the search terms and strategies for the manufacturer's review of the literature up to 18 November 2010. The manufacturer searched multiple databases, including EMBASE, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and CENTRAL to identify relevant studies assessing the clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and adverse effects of ranibizumab in patients with macular oedema (MO) secondary to branch or central retinal vein occlusion (RVO). The manufacturer also carried out extensive searches of online trial registries and proceedings from several key conferences (including Association of Research in Vision and Ophthalmology [ARVO] and European Association for Vision and Eye Research [EVER]). The ERG considers the search strategy used by the manufacturer to be comprehensive. As the manufacturer highlights, the search strategy did not include search terms that limited the search results to only randomised controlled trials (RCTs); searches were limited to human studies. However, the MS states that only RCTs were included in the assessment on the clinical effectiveness of ranibizumab. The manufacturer used multiple search terms for conditions and treatments, including terms for interventions listed as comparators of interest in the final scope issued by NICE. Although search terms for best supportive care were not specifically included in the search strategy, the ERG is confident that studies in which best supportive care was a comparator would have been identified for appraisal. It is not clear whether reference lists of identified RCTs were evaluated for suitable studies. The manufacturer also carried out a separate search for the identification of non-RCT data for bevacizumab. As part of the clarification process, the ERG requested the search strategy used to identify non-RCT data on bevacizumab. The manufacturer supplied the search strategy as academic in confidence. The ERG notes that the manufacturer's search strategy was comprehensive and considers that all studies could have been identified.</p>
<p>The ERG validated the manufacturer's search in EMBASE, MEDLINE and Medline In-Process, and the Cochrane library (08/06/2011), and generated a comparable number of studies to that generated by the manufacturer's search.</p>
<p>The manufacturer restricted their search to English language studies. To assess the potential impact of omission of non-English language studies, the ERG assessed RCTs identified in the Cochrane library (which includes studies in all languages) against the criteria listed in the MS. Fifteen non-English language RCTs were identified, none of which the ERG thought relevant to the decision problem. As only a limited number of non-English language studies were identified, to investigate further, the ERG searched EMBASE and MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process using the manufacturer's search strategy for clinical effectiveness with and without the restriction to English language studies: the ERG did not deduplicate search results. In the search carried out by the ERG on 08/06/2011, limiting to English language studies reduced the number of potentially relevant studies by 434 studies in MEDLINE and 866 studies in EMBASE.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria used in Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion/exclusion criteria applied by the manufacturer for their systematic review are summarised in Table 2 of the ERG report (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The manufacturer presented flow diagrams of the numbers of studies included and excluded at each stage of the appraisal process.</p>
<p>The ERG would like to highlight that the manufacturer excluded reviews, meta-analyses, and pooled analysis during the appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) highlights using reference lists of these types of publication as a source of potential additional studies. However, the ERG considers that no relevant studies have been omitted from the Clinical Effectiveness section.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of the Manufacturer's Review of Cost-Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer provides a brief description of the review of published cost-effectiveness evidence. The databases searched and the search terms used appear to be reasonable and both inclusion and exclusion criteria are explicitly stated. The search identified only one cost-utility study of grid laser photocoagulation (GLP) in MO secondary to RVO. This study was not considered relevant to the decision problem, since it was entirely US-based and therefore not easily generalisable to the UK population.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by British Medical Journal Technology Assessment Group (BMJ-TAG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Quality of Included Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer assessed the quality of the three identified RCTs and rated BRAVO and CRUISE as high-quality. The manufacturer notes some methodological issues with ROCC. The ERG has validated the three RCTs and predominantly agrees with the manufacturer's assessments (see Appendix 2 of the ERG report [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for quality assessments).</p>
<p><strong>Meta-analysis of RCTs Identified for Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Macular Oedema (MO) Secondary to Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the CRUISE RCT, the manufacturer identified a second smaller RCT &ndash; the ROCC RCT assessing the effect of ranibizumab in the treatment of MO secondary to CRVO. The manufacturer carried out a meta-analysis of the two studies, presenting the data in the appendices of the manufacturer's submission (MS). The NICE <em>Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal</em> recommends that "Synthesis of outcome data through meta-analysis is appropriate provided there are sufficient relevant and valid data that use measures of outcome that are comparable". The ERG notes that is it appropriate to present the results from the meta-analysis for review. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that there is strong evidence (p &lt;0.00001) that, in patients with MO secondary to non-ischaemic CRVO, ranibizumab is more effective than sham injection at improving best corrected visual acuity (as measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] score) at month 6.</p>
<p>The manufacturer carried out a fixed effects analysis of the change in mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at month 6. The ERG replicated the meta-analysis carried out by the manufacturer and generated approximately the same result (see Figure 3 of the ERG report for forest plot from ERG analysis).</p>
<p>Although no heterogeneity was identified between the two studies (<em>I<sup>2</sup></em> = 0), the ERG thinks it useful to present a comparison of the patient characteristics of the populations included in CRUISE and ROCC (see Table 13 of the ERG report), and the individual results of the outcome assessed in the meta-analysis (mean change in BCVA from baseline at month 6). Data from ROCC for mean change in BCVA score from baseline at months 1 and 3 are also reported in Table 13 of the ERG report.</p>
<p>See Section 4 of the ERG report for additional information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Economic Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Summary of Manufacturer's Economic Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer developed a <em>de novo</em> cost utility model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab monotherapy in the treatment of patients with visual impairment due to MO secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).</p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The <em>de novo</em> cost utility analysis uses a Markov state transition model to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients, with a starting age of approximately 66 years, over a 15 year time horizon. The structure of the model is displayed in Figure 4 of the ERG report.</p>
<p>The model consists of eight different BCVA health states and the absorbing state of death; the BCVA health states are defined as bands of 10 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters (2 lines) based on the assumption that a change in visual acuity of two lines is clinically significant. Patients are initially distributed across the BCVA health states to reflect the baseline distribution of patients in the BRAVO and CRUISE trials for MO secondary to branch RVO (BRVO) and CRVO, respectively.</p>
<p>Each BCVA health state has an associated utility and mortality risk, depending on whether the better-seeing eye (BSE) or worse-seeing eye (WSE) is treated. In the base case analysis, it is assumed that all patients are treated in their BSE. Patients transition through the model in monthly cycles, accumulating the utility associated with each health state they enter, together with the costs of treatment and subsequent monitoring. In addition, patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) have an associated cost and disutility applied, and patients considered to be blind accumulate the additional costs of blindness; blindness is assumed to occur when patients have a visual acuity of &le;35 letters in their BSE.</p>
<p><strong>Critique of Manufacturer's Economic Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer's model is constructed in Microsoft&copy; Excel with Visual Basic for Applications used for navigation and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). The model is generally well constructed, with appropriate calculation methods used throughout. The model is very flexible, allowing numerous scenario analyses to be conducted, using new and existing data. However, there were many hidden sheets and unlabelled tables, that reduced the transparency of the model and the use of data tables to generate the deterministic sensitivity analysis and the screen updating the PSA led to a slow running model in which it was difficult to see the impact of the probabilistic mode on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).</p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The ERG considers the model structure to be overly complicated, with more health states than necessary to capture patient outcomes and therefore the potential to overestimate utility gains. As part of the clarification process, the ERG requested scenario analysis in which the model uses the pre-specified trial outcome of a gain/loss of &ge;15 letters rather than the analysis of 10 or more letters. The manufacturer failed to provide the requested analysis, citing time constraints.</p>

                    <p>Expert Consensus</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Cost Analysis</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions on the Manufacturer's Economic Model</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's original economic model and the critique and exploratory analyses performed by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). It broadly accepted the model structure, but was aware of the uncertainties highlighted by the ERG around the assumptions used by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The Committee also considered the manufacturer's revisions to its economic model submitted in response to consultation and broadly accepted the manufacturer's approach to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Reflecting that most patients (90%) would be treated in their 'worse-seeing eye' </li>
    <li>The use of utilities as applied using the Czoski-Murray equation, in absence of further evidence </li>
    <li>Applying unpooled transition probabilities although there was a lack of clear data </li>
    <li>The inclusion of updated adverse event rates in year 2, albeit cautiously </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered that a 0.3 utility gain associated with treating the 'worse-seeing eye' seems high given that utility is driven primarily by the 'better-seeing eye', and therefore lacked face validity.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that a utility gain of 0.1 associated with treating the 'worse-seeing eye' was appropriate.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the evidence on the risk of cardiovascular mortality associated with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was unclear, and therefore it need not be included in the base-case model to the degree applied in the original ERG report. However it would remain an uncertainty in the analysis.</p>
<p>The Committee acknowledged that there were advantages and disadvantages to the manufacturer and ERG's approaches (to applying unpooled transition probabilities). But it concluded that, given the lack of clear data, the approach taken by the manufacturer was appropriate.</p>
<p>Although the Committee acknowledged the ERG's concerns with the methods used to estimate adverse events in year 2, it cautiously accepted the updated safety data in the model.</p>
<p>The Committee accepted that the relative effectiveness of ranibizumab and dexamethasone was uncertain and concluded that it was difficult to quantify any bias.</p>
<p>The Committee was aware of the remaining uncertainty because of the absence of a direct comparison with dexamethasone.</p>
<p>The Committee was aware that people receiving ranibizumab in the BRAVO trial could receive grid laser photocoagulation from month 3 and that this represented a significant confounding factor in both the manufacturer's and the ERG's calculations of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) compared with standard care. It therefore considered that this ICER would be an underestimate of the most plausible ICER.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values/Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the BRAVO and CRUISE trials reported a statistically significant difference in National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) score at month 6 between the ranibizumab and sham injection groups. The Committee concluded that treating patients with ranibizumab improved the quality of life of people with macular oedema secondary to RVO.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that although uncertain, the use of utilities as applied using the Czoski-Murray equation was acceptable.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that a utility gain of 0.1 associated with treating the 'worse-seeing eye' was appropriate.</p>
<p>The Committee was not aware of any substantial benefits of ranibizumab over its comparators that would not be already captured into the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation in the modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-Effective?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that ranibizumab should be recommended as an option for treating visual impairment caused by macular oedema following BRVO if grid laser photocoagulation has not been beneficial or is not suitable because of the extent of macular haemorrhage.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-Effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The ERG exploratory analyses highlighted that the key drivers that increased the manufacturer's base-case incremental ICERs were amending the proportion of patients treated in their 'better-seeing eye' (10% instead of 100%) and the assumption of some benefit associated with treating the 'worse-seeing eye'.</p>
<p>The Committee considered that a 0.3 utility gain associated with treating the 'worse-seeing eye' seems high given that utility is driven primarily by the 'better-seeing eye', and therefore lacked face validity.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>Ranibizumab was associated with an ICER of &pound;26,200 per QALY gained compared with best supportive care in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the most plausible ICER for ranibizumab compared with standard care in treating BRVO was in excess of &pound;44,800 per QALY gained.</p></div></p>

    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the National Health Service (NHS) must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has visual impairment caused by macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that ranibizumab is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>The Department of Health and the manufacturer have agreed that ranibizumab will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme which makes ranibizumab available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations.
