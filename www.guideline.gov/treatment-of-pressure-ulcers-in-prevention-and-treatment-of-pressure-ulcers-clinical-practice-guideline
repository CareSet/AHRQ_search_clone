<p><strong>Databases</strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) identified clinical questions to guide literature searches. To identify the scientific literature on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment, several electronic databases were consulted, including: PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Biomedical Reference Collection, Health Business Elite, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment, and AMED databases. As the guideline builds on a previously published body of evidence, the search dates for this update were 1st January 2008 through 1st July 2013. Some Small Working Groups (SWGs), particularly those that were addressing evidence in topics newly introduced in this version of the guideline, used different inclusion dates, as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria detailed below.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A sensitive search strategy was developed and made available on the guideline website. The SWGs were permitted to conduct additional focused searches to ensure the full depth and breadth of their topic area has been covered.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>All references retrieved by the electronic literature search were screened by the methodologist (during the interim period between guideline development periods from 2009 to 2012) based on the following inclusion criteria:</p>
<p><em>General Eligibility Criteria</em></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The articles must be primarily focused on pressure ulcer prevention, risk assessment, or pressure ulcer treatment in human subjects. </li>
    <li>The articles must have been published in a peer reviewed journal. </li>
    <li>An abstract must be available. </li>
    <li>The studies should have used one of the following designs: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, survey studies, prevalence or incidence studies, case-control studies, and case series. </li>
    <li>At least ten subjects must have been included in any case series. </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were included if they used the Cochrane methodology or met at least 9 out of 11 quality criteria of the critical appraisal tool Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). </li>
    <li>SWG members reviewed, analyzed and used the original articles cited in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as the basis for guideline recommendations and systematic reviews were cited as additional supporting evidence. In order to rate the level of evidence, the quality of the systematic review was assessed, using the AMSTAR checklist. Meta-analyses should not be equated with systematic reviews. </li>
    <li>Studies using established qualitative methodologies were considered as appropriate to the research question. </li>
    <li>There was no restriction on the basis of the language of a study. However, studies published in languages other than English were required to indicate a high level of quality and unique data in the abstract report to warrant translation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-systematic literature reviews, narrative papers, opinion, commentary and descriptive papers. Papers falling into this category were used only to support expert opinion as required. </li>
    <li>Case series with less than 10 participants. </li>
    <li>Conference abstracts or other short papers with insufficient detail to enable an appraisal of the study methodology. </li>
    <li>Duplicate reports of research. </li>
    <li>Computational modeling and other research conducted in non-human subjects. </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that do not meet at least 9 of 11 criteria on the AMSTAR checklist. </li>
    <li>Papers without a substantial focus on pressure ulcer prevention or treatment or risk assessment. </li>
    <li>Foreign language studies for which the abstract does not indicate a high level study (i.e., at least Level 2) with unique data. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Eligibility Criteria for Research Reporting on Quality Improvement and Education</em></p>
<p>In addition to the criteria outlined above, additional inclusion criteria were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Articles with a time series design with at least three outcome measurement time points. </li>
    <li>Project should be institution-wide (i.e., not individual units). Projects in individual units could be covered in special population sections as appropriate (e.g., pediatrics, critical care). </li>
    <li>Outcomes should be incidence or facility-acquired pressure ulcer rates. </li>
    <li>Quality improvement projects should be described in sufficient detail to enable replication (i.e., specific methods used, barriers and facilitators). </li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Publications before January 2008 and after December 2012 were not appraised for this guideline section. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Eligibility Criteria for Research Reporting on Risk Factors for Pressure Ulcers</em></p>
<p>The systematic review by Coleman et al., 2013 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) was used as a basis for literature selection to identify patient characteristics that increase the probability of pressure ulcer development. This was supplemented by a search for literature published from 31st March 2010 to July 1st 2013.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix 1: Methodology of the original guideline document for inclusion and exclusion criteria used by Coleman et al. (see also the Methodology addendum [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p><em>Eligibility Criteria for Research Reporting on Risk Assessment Tools</em></p>
<p>Additional inclusion criteria for papers addressing the reliability of risk assessment tools were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Risk assessment tools are completed by qualified health professionals. </li>
    <li>The research involved comparing pressure ulcer risk assessment tool scores of different raters using the same scale (interrater) or comparing pressure ulcer risk assessment tool scores of the same raters using the same scale at different times (intrarater). </li>
</ul>
<p>The systematic review by Chou et al., 2013 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) was used as a basis for literature selection related to identifying the validity of risk assessment tools. This was supplemented by literature published after the end of the review period (i.e., from 31st July 2012 to 1st July 2013).</p>
<p>Additional inclusion criteria for papers addressing the validity of risk assessment tools were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prospective study design (i.e., RCTs, CCT, prospective cohort study). </li>
    <li>Reporting the evaluation of one or more risk assessment tool in the prevention of pressure ulcers (analytical methods). </li>
    <li>Follow-up data included on at least 75% of participants. </li>
    <li>Participants were aged over 18 years. </li>
    <li>Individuals were assessed systematically for the development of new pressure ulcers (e.g., all participants have baseline skin assessment and at follow-up intervals suitable to identify new pressure ulcers in the study population). Assessment only at baseline and discharge is not a suitable follow-up to detect all new pressure ulcers. </li>
    <li>Risk assessment tools are completed at baseline. </li>
    <li>Outcome clearly defined as development of a Category/Stage I or greater pressure ulcer. </li>
    <li>Analysis methods: sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), relative risk and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. </li>
</ul>
<p>Exclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Data used to generate the risk assessment tool are the same data used for the calculation of validity measures. </li>

<p>Studies of pressure ulcers in humans and individuals at risk of, or with existing pressure ulcers were considered 'direct evidence' and were required to support an A or B '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' rating (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). When studies of pressure ulcers in humans at risk of, or with existing pressure ulcers were not available, studies in normal human subjects, human subjects with other types of chronic wounds, laboratory studies using animals, or computational models were used as indirect evidence to support recommendations with a C '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' rating.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluating the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Appraisal of Methodological Quality</strong></p>
<p>The methodological quality of each study was evaluated by two members of the Small Working Groups (SWGs). Where large discrepancy of opinion was noted (such that the paper's overall quality was rated differently by the two reviewers), a third reviewer evaluated the paper. The methodologist completed a quality check on a random sample of 80% of the critical appraisals for papers selected for potential appraisal, including those papers that the SWG assessed as not meeting inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>The methodological quality of each study was assessed by two reviewers using methodology checklists that were based on tools developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Evaluation of study quality focused on the internal and external validity of the studies. The following quality criteria were considered: internal validity of the study; clear and appropriate research question(s); selection of subjects; allocation; baseline comparability; outcomes; blinding; confounding factors; statistical analysis; overall assessment of the study; and bias.&nbsp;A range of critical appraisal tools were used based on different types of study design: cross-sectional/survey/prevalence studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, diagnostic studies, SQUIRE guideline checklist for quality improvement papers, Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist, AMSTAR criteria for systematic reviews.</p>
<p>Each criterion on the critical appraisal forms was assessed as being fully met (++), partially met (+), not met/not reported/unclear (&mdash;), or not applicable (NA). Studies were generally described as high, moderate, or low quality using the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>High quality studies: fully met at least 80% of applicable criteria </li>
    <li>Moderate quality studies: partially or fully met at least 70% of applicable criteria </li>
    <li>Low quality studies: did not partially or fully met at least 70% of applicable criteria </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Appraisal of Methodological Quality for Risk Factor Papers</em></p>
<p>In the absence of guidelines for the quality assessment of risk factor studies, Coleman et al., 2013 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) used an assessment framework based upon guidelines for assessing quality and risk of bias in prognostic studies and methodological considerations in the analysis, meta-analysis and publication of observational studies. Each study was appraised using the method described by Coleman et al. and the following factors were considered:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Baseline characteristics are adequately described </li>
    <li>Study attrition: clear definition of risk factors </li>
    <li>Continuous variables used or appropriate cut-points for continuous data </li>
    <li>Risk factor measurement valid and reliable </li>
    <li>Method/sampling of measurement used for all individual patients </li>
    <li>Appropriate imputation methods </li>
    <li>Appropriate classification for outcome </li>
    <li>Potential confounders accounted for in study design </li>
    <li>Potential confounders accounted for in analysis </li>
    <li>No selective reporting </li>
</ul>
<p>See Appendix 1 in the original guideline document and the Methodology addendum (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for more information on appraisal of methodological quality for risk factor papers.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The level of evidence for individual intervention studies was noted for each study containing direct evidence, using a classification system adapted from Sackett, 1989 (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p>Levels of evidence are typically applied to intervention studies (e.g., RCTs, controlled clinical trials [CCTs], or case series studies) because these types of studies are regarded as most important knowledge sources for clinical decision making. However, there are many more study designs (e.g., epidemiological or descriptive studies) that provide valuable evidence to guide practice, yet cannot be classified with an intervention-based level of evidence system.</p>
<p>Studies on diagnostic and prognostic validity of pressure ulcer risk and pressure ulcer classification form an important body of knowledge in pressure ulcer management that should be appraised independently from intervention studies. Diagnostic accuracy studies are studies in which results of index tests are compared with results from reference standards at the same point in time. Therefore, cross-sectional designs are needed to establish the concurrent existence of both index test and reference standard results. Most studies in pressure ulcer risk research are not diagnostic accuracy studies according to this widely agreed upon definition, because the measured pressure ulcer risk is often compared with subsequent pressure ulcer occurrence. These designs resemble those of prognostic studies or diagnostic accuracy studies with imperfect reference standards.</p>
<p>Comparable to different phases of intervention research phases of diagnostic and prognostic research can also be distinguished. In diagnostic research, Phase I and II studies focus on differentiation between individuals with the target from those without. Phase III studies are typical diagnostic accuracy studies whereas phase IV research investigates the clinical impact of diagnostic procedures. Prognostic studies are comparable with diagnostic accuracy studies with the difference that based on factors or diagnostic cues future events are predicted. These types of studies are typically used to develop prognostic models. Prognostic models (e.g., pressure ulcer risk assessment tool scores), are used to predict the probability of future events in individuals or groups.</p>
<p>Test accuracy and validity estimates are only surrogate measures for clinical effectiveness. The clinical effectiveness of diagnostic test procedures can only be adequately investigated by diagnostic RCTs. In case of diagnostic or prognostic RCTs the described level of evidence hierarchy of intervention studies is used.</p>
<p>Corresponding "level of evidence" hierarchies for diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and many other studies have been proposed and have been adopted by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) in the guideline update (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p>The technical documents summarizing critical appraisals of included studies are made available at the guideline website (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The full papers of selected references were obtained and&nbsp;made available to the relevant SWGs on a web-based (GoogleDocs) platform.</p>
<p>A data extraction template was used to extract relevant data from individual papers, including study design, description of participants, study groups and interventions, outcome measures, length of follow up, study results, and comments and limitations. Preliminary data extraction tables were prepared in the interim development period (i.e., period between the publication of the 2009 guideline and the commencement of the 2014 guideline development period).</p>
<p>The members of the SWGs were provided with the preliminary data extraction tables for checking, expanding on details and adding studies that had not yet undergone data extraction. The methodologist completed a quality check of a random sample of 80% of the completed evidence tables and the GDG completed a quality check of a random sample of 10% of the completed evidence tables.</p>
<p>The technical documents summarizing data extraction of included studies are made available at the guideline website (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Participants</span></strong></p>
<p>All members of the development team were screened for experience, expertise and potential conflicts of interest. In the interest of transparency, all guideline developers were asked to complete a form identifying potential conflicts of interest that covered the guideline review period.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Group</strong></p>
<p>This second edition of the guideline was conducted by European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) and the Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (PPPIA). The Pan Pacific Alliance consists of the Australian Wound Management Association Incorporated (AWMA), the New Zealand Wound Care Society (NZWCS), the Hong Kong Enterostomal Therapist Society and the Wound Healing Society of Singapore.</p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) determined and monitored each step of the guideline development process, as well as managing guideline dissemination strategy. Each of the three partner organizations nominated four representatives each to form the 12 member GDG. From its nominated representatives, each partner organization appointed a Chair. The three partner organizations each had four votes during joint deliberations, with the majority deciding. Examination of the evidence and consensus building preceded all voting. Minority opinions were represented in meeting minutes. A full description of the GDG role is available on the guideline website.</p>
<p>A nonvoting observer from the Japanese Society of Pressure Ulcers (JSPU) attended GDG meetings during the 2014 revision process, with the option to join the GDG for the next revision.</p>
<p><strong>Small Working Groups</strong></p>
<p>The guideline content was divided into working topic areas, and Small Working Groups (SWGs) were formed to review the evidence available for each topic. The SWG members were selected by each participating organization based on an experience and expertise. Representatives of industry were excluded from SWGs. The SWGs were formed based on the principle of equal contribution from all participating organizations. A full description of the SWG role is available on the guideline website. A total of 104 SWG members contributed to the guideline development process, with many members contributing to more than one SWG.</p>
<p>Guideline development was an iterative process, with GDG and SWG members maintaining communication via the methodologist. Evidence summaries and draft recommendations developed by the SWGs were reviewed by the GDG for:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Comprehensiveness and accuracy of literature reviews </li>
    <li>Methodological rigor in evidence analysis and application to clinical practice </li>
    <li>Clarity and appropriateness of recommendations for an international audience </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodologist</strong></p>
<p>The guideline process was overseen by an experienced guideline methodologist. The methodologist assisted the SWG members in implementing the documented methodology, appraising and summarizing the new literature, revising the 2009 guideline recommendations and developing new recommendations, and presenting the evidence. The methodologist also managed the confidential consensus voting process (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE]). The methodologist provided a link between the GDG and the SWG, managing communication and maintaining progress. The methodologist attended GDG and SWG meetings, but did not participate in GDG voting.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>The entire process of developing the guideline was made available to stakeholders on the guideline website. Anyone was invited to register as a stakeholder, either as an individual or as a representative for a society/organization. All members of the EPUAP, NPUAP and PPPIA were invited to register as stakeholders and participate in this process. When new sections of the guideline were made available on the guideline website, registered stakeholders were notified by electronic mail. The GDG reviewed all stakeholder comments and any additional evidence recommended by stakeholders before approving final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drafting/Revising Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on the identified, appraised and summarized empirical evidence recommendations were formed. Each SWG formulated conclusions about the body of available evidence based on the evidence tables and critical appraisals and levels of evidence. Evidence tables from previous guidelines were also made available to SWGs to ensure the full body of scientific literature was reviewed. A first draft of recommendations was developed by the respective SWGs using the 2009 guideline recommendations as a guide. The GDG reviewed the draft recommendations, making revisions as necessary.</p>
<p>To ensure uniformity and internal consistency in the final guideline, the GDG provided the following guidance.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Each recommendation should start with an action verb and be a simple, short, direct, declarative statement, free of jargon. </li>
    <li>Multiple complex recommendations were broken down into a series of smaller, discrete recommendations. </li>
    <li>The SWGs were advised to start with broad, directive statements, followed by subsequent statements with more detail (how, when, how often). </li>
    <li>Recommendations should be specific and unambiguous. </li>
    <li>When available, information on health benefits, side effects and risks should be provided. </li>
    <li>Spelling will be based on the conventions of American English. </li>
</ul>
<p>The GDG reviewed all recommendations to ensure the wording of the recommendations accurately translated available research into best practice while being sensitive to the many different individual cultures and professional standards represented among the international audience for these guidelines.</p>
<p>The term "individual" was selected to describe the patient, client, resident, or person with a pressure ulcer or at risk for a pressure ulcer. The terms "health professional" and "interprofessional team" were used when referring to health professional providing professional health care services to the individual. The disciplines of professionals performing a given service may vary from country to country based on the laws and regulations governing health care providers. Products available in one country may not be available in another. Generic names were used when referring to drugs and other products.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assigning Strength of Evidence Ratings</span></strong></p>
<p>'<strong><em>Strength of evidence</em></strong>' ratings were assigned to recommendations (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). This rating identifies the strength of cumulative body of evidence supporting each recommendation.</p>
<p>A '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' rating of A requires Level 1 studies conducted in individuals with pressure ulcers or at risk for pressure ulcers. This rating is consistent with recommendations derived using the Cochrane methodology. '<strong><em>Strength of evidence</em></strong>' ratings of B required Level 2, 3, 4, and/or 5 studies in these populations. Recommendations supported by A and B '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' ratings were developed first. This strategy provided recommendations with very direct evidentiary support. Where the guideline was considered to lack the breadth and depth of guidance necessary to provide care, additional recommendations based on expert opinion and/or indirect evidence and given a '<em>strength of evidence</em>' rating of C were developed to fill the evidence gap.</p>
<p>The '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' supporting the recommendation is not the same as the '<strong><em>strength of the recommendation</em></strong>'. For example, there are no randomized controlled trials in individuals with pressure ulcers that evaluate debridement compared to no debridement. Therefore, this recommendation would have a relatively low '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' supporting the recommendation, yet the recommendation is strongly recommended in many clinical situations based on evidence from studies of other types of chronic wounds, proof of principle from basic science research, and/or expert opinion.</p>
<p>In this guideline, evidence gaps have been explicitly identified. Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify indirect evidence from studies of normal subjects, studies with intermediate or surrogate outcomes, studies of humans with other types of chronic wounds, and animal studies. For many recommendations, indirect evidence may be identified to support C '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' ratings. In the absence of indirect evidence, consensus from previous guidelines or expert opinion may support C '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' ratings, providing a broader base of expert opinion than that available in the SWGs and GDG. The SWG members were encouraged to evaluate previous guidelines for quality using the AGREE II Tool. All recommendations, including those supported solely by expert opinion were reviewed by stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summarizing Supporting Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The SWGs summarized the evidence supporting each recommendation. An explicit link between the recommendation and supporting evidence was expected. The strengths and limitations of this body of evidence were clearly described. All recommendations with a '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' rating of A or B required an explicit summary of one or more studies conducted with human subjects with pressure ulcers or at risk for pressure ulcer development. The '<strong><em>level of evidence</em></strong>' for each study is also identified in the summary.</p>
<p>The summary statements for recommendations with a '<strong><em>strength of evidence</em></strong>' of C clarify whether the recommendation was supported by:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Indirect evidence from studies of normal subjects </li>
    <li>Studies with intermediate or surrogate outcomes </li>
    <li>Studies of humans with other types of chronic wounds, and animal studies or other basic bench research </li>
    <li>Expert opinion supported by previous evidence-based guidelines </li>
    <li>The expert opinion of the SWG and GDG members as reviewed by international stakeholders. </li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence gaps identified in these summary statements serve as an agenda for future research efforts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assigning Strength of Recommendation Grades</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations are rated based on their importance and their potential to improve individual patient outcomes. The '<em>strength of recommendation</em>' is the extent to which a health professional can be confident that adherence to the recommendation will do more good than harm. The grading of importance is not necessarily related to the strength of internal or external evidence. The overall aim is to help health professionals to prioritize interventions. See the original guideline document for points to be considered in grading the strength of recommendations.</p>
<p>The '<strong><em>strength of recommendation</em></strong>' grades were achieved via a formal consensus process using the GRADE grid (see Table 5 in Appendix 1 in the original guideline document and in the Methodology addendum [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). In this consensus process all SWG and the GDG members were invited to take part, each voting on every recommendation in the guideline. The consensus voting process (GRADE) was conducted on the website. Each guideline development team member was provided with a unique identification. Before commencing in the GRADE process, the methodology was outlined, including the considerations to be made in casting a vote. The participant was required to nominate their understanding of the procedure before commencing, or to request further information.</p>

<p>In 2009, a total of 903 individuals and 146 societies/organizations registered as stakeholders. These stakeholders were all invited to register as stakeholders for the 2014 guideline. Additionally, patient representative organizations were also invited to participate in the stakeholder review process to provide a consumer perspective. A total of 988 individuals were formally invited to register as stakeholders, and many more received information about the process through colleagues and organizations. A total of 698 individuals registered as stakeholders to provide feedback as an individual or in representation of a society/organization.</p>
<p>When new sections of the guideline were made available on the guideline website, registered stakeholders were notified by electronic mail. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) reviewed all stakeholder comments and any additional evidence recommended by stakeholders before approving final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Final Review and Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Following review and approval of individual recommendations, the methodologist and the GDG reviewed all guideline documents for internal consistency, logical coherence and adherence to the guideline methodology. Based on this final review, the GDG will provide a global assessment of the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence supporting the guideline and recommendation for future research.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Use conservative sharp debridement with caution in the presence of: immune incompetence, compromised vascular supply, or lack of antibacterial coverage in systemic sepsis. </li>
    <li>Care should be taken to avoid causing injury when probing the depth of a wound bed or determining the extent of undermining or tunneling. </li>
    <li>Topically applied opioids may be associated with increased systemic side effects in individuals taking systemic opioids. Local itching and irritation has been reported, but not more frequently than when a placebo gel is applied.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Caution must be exercised using conservative sharp debridement in immunocompromised individuals to avoid large open cavities that may serve as portals for opportunistic infection. Additionally, caution must be exerted in those individuals with bleeding disorders and those taking anticoagulants. </li>
    <li>Topical antiseptics
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Cytotoxicity is the main concern when applying a topical agent on an open wound. Antiseptics have been found, primarily using <em>in vitro</em> models, to be cytotoxic to cells essential to the wound healing process, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and leukocytes. However, this cytotoxicity appears to be concentration-dependent. </li>
        <li>Sodium hypochlorite (Dakin's solution) is cytotoxic at all concentrations and should be used with caution, at concentrations no greater than 0.025%, for short periods only when no other appropriate option is available. </li>
        <li>There is a risk of acidosis when acetic acid is used for extended periods over large wound surface areas. </li>
        <li>Topical antiseptics should be discontinued when infection is managed, or the wound starts to heal, or if the patient experiences any adverse reaction to the agent. </li>
        <li>Silver may have toxic properties, especially to keratinocytes and fibroblasts; the extent of the toxicities is not fully described. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Before applying a honey dressing, ensure the individual is not allergic to honey. </li>
    <li>Iodine toxicity has been reported in a few case studies, especially in those individuals with large wounds, in whom dressings were changed often. The risk of systemic absorption increases when iodine products are used on larger, deeper wound or for prolonged periods. It is not recommended for individuals taking lithium, or for pregnant or breast-feeding women. </li>
    <li>Caution is recommended for electromagnetic therapy in individuals with fever, active bleeding, seizures or dehydration. </li>
    <li>Electrotherapy should be used with caution in individuals with impaired circulation or devitalized tissue. </li>
    <li>Cautious use by an experienced health professional is recommended for individuals on anticoagulant therapy; in actively bleeding wounds; or where the wound is in close proximity to major blood vessels. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Debridement
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Autolytic debridement is contraindicated in the presence of untreated infection or extensive necrotic tissue, in large ulcers with undermining and sinus tracts, and in individuals with compromised immunity. </li>
        <li>Biological debridement (larval therapy) should not be used where there are exposed blood vessels; acute infections that are limb- or life-threatening; ulcers requiring frequent inspections; necrotic bone or tendon tissues; or circulatory impairment significant enough to impair ability to heal. </li>
        <li>Relative contraindications to conservative sharp debridement include anticoagulant therapy and bleeding disorders. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Topical antiseptics
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Iodine products should be avoided in patients with impaired renal failure, history of thyroid disorders or known iodine sensitivity. </li>
        <li>Hydrogen peroxide is highly toxic to tissues even at low concentrations and should not be used as a preferred topical antiseptic. Its use should be totally avoided in cavity wounds due to the risk of surgical emphysema and gas embolus. </li>
        <li>Topical silver products should not be used on individuals with silver sensitivities, and silver sulfadiazine products are not recommended for people with sulfur sensitivities. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid using gauze dressings for open pressure ulcers that have been cleansed and debrided because they are labor-intensive, cause pain when removed if dry, and lead to desiccation of viable tissue if they dry. </li>
    <li>Manufacturers of devices used to administer electromagnetic therapy do not recommend their use in individuals with pacemakers or other electrical implants, pregnancy or organ transplant. </li>
    <li>Electrotherapy is contraindicated in individuals with electrical implants (e.g., pacemakers), or who are pregnant. Electrotherapy is also contraindicated in local anatomical areas of the eye, testes and any malignancy. </li>
    <li>Noncontact low frequency ultrasound spray should not be used near prostheses, near electronic implanted devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers), over the lower back or uterus in pregnant women; or over areas of malignancy; or on the face/head. </li>
    <li>Individuals with dependent lower extremity edema or peripheral vascular disease, immunocompromised individuals, those who are mechanically ventilated and lethargic, and incontinent individuals should never be immersed. </li>
    <li>Use of ultrasound is not recommended over anatomical areas with implanted materials or devices. </li>
    <li>Negative pressure wound therapy is not recommended in inadequately debrided, necrotic or malignant wounds; where vital organs are exposed; in wounds with no exudate; or in individuals with untreated coagulopathy, osteomyelitis or local or systemic clinical infection. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The newly introduced implementation section of the guideline addresses systems and strategy at an organization and professional level that are required for effective implementation of the clinical recommendations in this guideline. This includes sections addressing implementation strategy, health professional education, recommendations specifically for patient consumers and their caregivers, and quality indicators for monitoring guideline implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitators, Barriers and Implementation Strategy</strong></p>
<p>This section of the guideline provides a review of quality improvement research published from 1st January, 2008 to 31st December, 2012. Quality of evidence in this field is extremely varied, and the Small Working Group (SWG) narrowed the research by seeking evidence of sustained effectiveness of reproducible interventions. Assessment of potential barriers and facilitators to guideline implementation, including education level of staff and appropriate equipment is essential prior to the introduction of a pressure ulcer prevention protocol. The evidence supporting practical strategies including nurse-led quality improvement, introduction of wound care specialists and awareness campaigns is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Health Professional Education</strong></p>
<p>Negative attitudes and lack of knowledge are common barriers to using guidelines in clinical practice. This section of the guideline provides a review of research on the effectiveness of strategies related to health professional education published from 1st January, 2008 to 31st December, 2012. Recommendations on the format, content and evaluation of education programs are made.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Consumers and Their Caregivers</strong></p>
<p>The patient consumer and his or her informal caregivers play an important role in pressure ulcer prevention. Knowledge of pressure ulcers and their prevention is important, and requires a special emphasis in those at high risk. This section of the guideline discusses responsibilities of the patient consumer to attain information and work with health professionals in order to prevent and treat pressure ulcers. The section also provides guidance on the selection and maintenance of equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Indicators for This Guideline</strong></p>
<p>Monitoring of practice is an important component of continuous quality improvement. The quality indicators identified in this section of the guideline are intended for auditing the implementation of this clinical guideline in practice. The identified quality indicators are those that are considered important indicators of successful implementation of the guideline and delivery of quality pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. The indicators could be used by organizations who introduce the evidence-based practices recommended within this guideline, and may be measured in conjunction with other quality indicators (e.g., those associated with facility accreditation) to determine progress in provision of quality care and identify areas for improvement.</p>
