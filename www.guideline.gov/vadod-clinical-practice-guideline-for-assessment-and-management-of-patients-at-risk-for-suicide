    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
        <li>Patients who continue to be at risk for suicide and do not arrive to their follow-up appointment require a reassessment of risk, since not showing may demonstrate a risk behavior. The assessment should include: locating the patient and establishing contact, reassessment of level of risk, reinforcement of the safety plan, and directing the patient to the appropriate level of care. </li>
        <li>If patient contact cannot be established, available data should be used to reassess the level of risk and corresponding effort should be made to locate the patient though direct contacts (e.g., next of kin), other points of available contacts (friends, peers, command), or, in cases of high acute risk, local emergency response (mobile crisis team, law enforcement). </li>

    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>When patients are identified in primary care with intermediate or high acute risk for suicide they should be evaluated by behavioral health providers. Warm handoffs are helpful in ensuring that patients receive the evaluations they require without interruption. </li>
        <li>All providers involved in the patient's care must actively attempt to connect with others in the suicidal patients' chain of healthcare (e.g., primary care) and with the patient's consent, helping services network (e.g., chaplains) to ensure timely communication, coordination of care, and aftercare. </li>
        <li>As patients are recovering from crisis and reduce their risk for suicide they may also be transitioning to less restrictive care settings, as to routine care by primary clinicians. It is the responsibility of the healthcare team to update the patient's written Safety Plan over time. </li>

    <p><em>R2. Documentation of Clinical Care</em></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
        <li>Adequate clinical documentation of the care provided to suicidal patients is required for optimizing continuity of care. Providers must consider ethical, clinical, and legal issues when documenting their assessment, management and treatment of suicidal patients. </li>

    <li>The DoD Task Force on the Prevention of Suicide by Members of the Armed Forces, established by the Fiscal Year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. The Final Report (August 2010) made several recommendations regarding suicide prevention. A multidisciplinary panel of experts from DoD, VA, Health and Human Services (SAMHSA), and academia agreed upon these recommendations. Recommendation 59 stated:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Recommendation 59</strong>: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Develop clinical practice guidelines</em></span> </strong>to promote the utilization of evidence-based practices for the assessment, management, and treatment of suicide-related behaviors. </li>

<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Two groups have reviewed the body of research on suicide prevention approaches previously. Three systematic reviews were conducted of literature related to suicidal self-directed violence published since those two prior reports on the topic published in 2004 and 2005. The first review focused on veterans and members of the military and was conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Evidence-based Synthesis Program and published in 2009. The review considered studies reporting direct effects of interventions on suicide attempts or completions. Studies reporting results from any country for military or veterans were included, as were studies in Anglo/American countries with adult populations reporting interventions other than strictly mental health interventions. The other two reviews were conducted by the VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program (ESP) to specifically address the PICO questions developed by the WG. They also focused on countries and populations of interest similar to US veteran and military populations and included randomized clinical trial intervention studies of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, follow-up and referral. Additional studies that were reviewed were observational studies identifying risk factors for suicide and studies evaluating the validity of assessment. The two reviews were published by the VA ESP in two reports.</p>
<p>To identify relevant systematic reviews and controlled trials, the review searched PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and covered the period from January 2005 to November 18, 2011. The search strategy was similar to that used for the 2005 and 2004 reports. The search included suicide and all related terms; risk assessment, screening and validity, interventions and Veteran populations as search terms. The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles involving human subjects and published in the English language that were not included in previously published systematic reviews on the topic.</p>
<p>To assure that the search did not miss relevant articles on suicidal self-directed violence assessment and management, additional articles were obtained from systematic reviews, reference lists of pertinent studies, reviews, editorials, and consulting experts.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The evidence selection process was designed to identify the best available evidence to address each key question and ensure maximum coverage of studies at the top of the hierarchy of study types. Published, peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as meta-analyses and systematic reviews that included randomized controlled studies, were considered to constitute the strongest level of evidence in support of guideline recommendations. This decision was based on the judgment that RCTs provide the clearest, most scientifically sound basis for judging comparative efficacy. The WG also recognized the limitations of RCTs, particularly considerations of generalizability with respect to patient selection and treatment quality. When available, the search sought out critical appraisals already performed by others that described explicit criteria for deciding what evidence was selected and how it was determined to be valid. The sources that have already undergone rigorous critical appraisal include Cochrane Reviews, Best Evidence, Technology Assessment, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic evidence reports, and other published Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines.</p>
<p>The WG also reviewed larger syntheses of the literature that are guiding work in suicide prevention nationally and internationally, as well as an unpublished (at the time) synthesis of the literature produced by the National Institute of Health in the UK (draft self-harm clinical practice guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] 2011), and a draft of the systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that was shared for review in progress of updating the earlier 2004 review. These additional searches and reviews of documents were done in an attempt to include any articles reporting on any strategies addressing suicidal self-directed violence as an outcome and to obtain the most comprehensive list of articles possible.</p>
<p>The following inclusion criteria were used to select the articles identified in the literature for possible inclusion:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Published in United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Japan, New Zealand </li>
    <li>Full articles only published in English </li>
    <li>Study populations: age limited to adults 18 years of age or older; all races, ethnicities, and cultural groups </li>
    <li>Relevant outcomes able to be abstracted from the data presented in the articles </li>
    <li>Sample sizes appropriate for the study question addressed in the paper. RCTs were included if they were initiated with 30 or more participants </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Result</strong></p>
<p>An initial global literature search yielded 23 systematic reviews/meta-analyses and 38 eight RCTs (reported in 47 publications) addressing pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, referral and follow-up interventions.</p>
<p>For studies addressing the key questions regarding risk factors and assessment tools, 30 observational studies and 14 systematic reviews (reported in 16 publications) were considered. Refinement of the review process with input from the WG members resulted in the studies being identified that met the baseline criteria for inclusion, addressed one or more of the researchable questions, and covered topic areas that had either not been addressed in the previous reviews or had been included but not fully developed. A more detailed search was conducted on each question, supplemented by hand searches and cross-referencing to search for relevant articles. The searches for these questions covered the period since the end search date of the evidence reports (between November 2011 and August 2012).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Evidence tables were developed to demonstrate the study characteristics and results for all included studies, organized by key question and study design. The Working Group (WG) critically analyzed studies to compare their characteristics, methods, and findings; compiled a summary of findings for each key question; and drew conclusions based on qualitative synthesis of the findings. The reports included findings as described in the prior systematic reviews and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2011 draft report on self-harm in order to assess contributions of pre-2005 and non-Veteran, non-military literature to this report. Due to the differences in scope and methods in these other reports, data synthesis of the findings is limited to a narrative summary.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation and Quality Rating</strong></p>
<p>Evidence-based practice involves integrating clinical expertise with the best available clinical evidence derived from systematic research.</p>
<p>The results of the searches, the evidence tables, and copies of the original studies were provided to the WG for further analysis. The clinical experts from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) WG reviewed the results and evaluated the strength of the evidence, considering quality of the body of evidence (made up of the individual studies) and the significance of the net benefit (potential benefit minus possible harm) for each intervention.</p>
<p>The overall strength of each body of evidence that addresses a particular Key Question was assessed using methods adapted from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2001). To assign an overall quality (QE) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" field) of the evidence (good, fair, or poor), the number, quality, and size of the studies; consistency of results between studies; and directness of the evidence were considered. Consistent results from a number of higher-quality studies (LE) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" field) across a broad range of populations supports with a high degree of certainty that the results of the studies are true and therefore the entire body of evidence would be considered "good" quality. A "fair" quality was assigned to the body of evidence indicating that the results could be due to true effects or to biases present across some or all of the studies. For a "poor" quality body of evidence, any conclusion is uncertain due to serious methodological shortcomings, sparse data, or inconsistent results.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline for Assessment and Management of Risk for Suicide was developed following the general strategy described in "Guideline for Guidelines," an internal working document of the VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Working Group, that requires an ongoing review of guideline works in progress.</p>
<p>The Offices of Quality Safety and Values and Patient Care Services of the VA, and the Army Medical Command of the DoD identified clinical leaders to champion the guideline development process. During a preplanning conference meeting, the clinical leaders defined the scope of the guideline and identified a group of clinical experts from the VA and DoD to form the Assessment and Management of Risk for Suicide Working Group (WG). The WG's participants were drawn from the fields of primary care, psychiatry, psychology, pharmacology, nursing, and social work.</p>
<p>Recommendations for assessment of suicide risk and management of patients at risk for suicide were derived through a rigorous methodological approach that included the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Determining appropriate criteria such as effectiveness, efficacy, and patients benefit </li>
    <li>Reviewing literature to determine the strength of the evidence in relation to these criteria </li>
    <li>Formulating the recommendations and grading the level of evidence supporting the recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working Group Meetings</strong></p>
<p>The WG participated in a 4-day face-to-face meeting to reach consensus about the guideline algorithm and evidence-based recommendations and to prepare a draft document. The draft continued to be revised by the WG through numerous conference calls and individual contributions to the document. The group was divided to several subtask groups that focused on different aspects of the guideline (i.e., recommendation for pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, assessment, etc.)</p>
<p>The plenary group convened to discuss discrepancies in opinion and interpretation of the evidence. In most cases, an informal consensus within the WG was sufficient to formulate recommendations based on the best evidence and/or experience of the clinical experts. In areas where this approach did not lead to conclusion, the facilitator used a structured discussion format (i.e., a modified nominal group process) to expedite the process and reach consensus based on the collective experience of the group. Where existing literature was ambiguous, or where scientific data was lacking on an issue, the recommendations were based on the clinical experience of the WG.</p>
<p><strong>Formulation of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>This Guideline is the product of many months of diligent effort and consensus building among knowledgeable individuals from the VA and DoD. An experienced moderator facilitated the multidisciplinary WG. The guideline was developed, reviewed and evolved over three major iterations. The entire WG developed consensus for the scope and structure of the guideline. The co-chairs and subject matter experts reviewed the available evidence, and collectively completed and reviewed the first draft of recommendations based on the available evidence. The Recommendations were sent to the whole WG for comment. Comments and modifications of the text suggested by the members of the WG were integrated into a second draft that was again reviewed for clarity and consistency by the co-chairs. Suggested changes to the algorithm and annotation were discussed over conference calls until all disagreements were resolved and the entire group achieved a consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation and Quality Rating</strong></p>
<p>The Strength of Recommendation (SR) was determined based on the Quality of the Evidence (QE), and the clinical significance of the net benefit (NB) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) for each intervention, as demonstrated by the body of evidence. Thus, the grade (i.e., A, B, C, D or I) assigned to guideline recommendations reflect both variables; the quality of the evidence and the potential clinical benefit that the intervention may provide to patients (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>Due to the limitation in the evidence and the quality of the studies the WG preferred to grade some recommendation using a grade <strong>[I]</strong> rather than a grade <strong>[D]</strong> as a result of limited options and no alternative interventions in some cases despite the lack of demonstrated net benefit.</p></div></p>

    <li>The aim of hospitalization is to provide immediate, short‐term safety for suicidal individuals, and begin to implement treatment; however, hospital admission itself is associated with several potential risks, including stigmatization. This can be highly detrimental for some individuals who may already be dealing with extremely low self‐esteem, by increasing their experience of being marginalized and alienated. The risks associated with hospitalization are not limited to the patient at high risk for suicide, but also to the potentially negative effect of hospitalization on the outcome for those diagnosed with major psychiatric disorders. For some, such as those with borderline personality disorder, inpatient admission has the potential to foster dependence, exacerbating their symptoms and risk for suicide. </li>
    <li>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is not without risk, which includes both adverse outcomes such as death in .002% and adverse side effects including temporary confusion and memory loss. Modern ECT techniques have substantially reduced the memory effects experienced by most patients. ECT death is usually the result of cardiovascular complications in patients who are already having cardiovascular compromise. Fractures are minimized by the use of muscle relaxants; however, teeth may still be broken during the treatment. Headaches and muscle soreness are usually relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nausea by anti-emetics. Seventy-five percent of patients report that memory impairment is the worse side effect they experience. </li>
    <li>Disadvantages of assessment tools in general
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Forms are no substitute for spending time to know the patient </li>
        <li>Only a few single suicide risk assessment methods have been empirically tested for reliability and validity </li>
        <li>Standard practice encompasses a wide range of reasoned clinical approaches. The clinician's duty is to perform a competent suicide risk assessment by using a reasonable method. </li>
        <li>When substituted for clinical assessment, forms can increase the risk of missing a patient's suicidal intent. </li>
        <li>Forms tend to be focused on an event, whereas clinical assessment is a process. </li>
        <li>The best scales cannot perform the integrative function of clinical assessment and judgment. </li>
        <li>The range of general and individual suicide risk factors cannot be captured by any instrument, regardless of how sophisticatedly constructed. </li>
        <li>May result in false positive that may lead to unnecessary or harmful interventions </li>
        <li>Can take valuable clinical time to complete (especially in primary care) and negatively affect patient satisfaction. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adverse Effects of Medications</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In one study, use of an antidepressant by patients younger than 25 years was associated with an increased suicidal behavior compared to those assigned to placebo. Young adults (18 to 24) started on an antidepressant for treatment of depression or another psychiatric disorder should be monitored and observed closely for emergence or worsening of suicidal thoughts or behaviors during the initiation phase of treatment. </li>
    <li>Patients who are treated with antipsychotics should be monitored for changes in behavior and emergence of suicidal thoughts during the initiation phase of treatment or after any change in dosage. </li>
    <li>Lithium should be avoided or used with caution in patients with impaired renal function, those taking concurrent medications that increase or decrease lithium concentrations or those with other risk factors for lithium toxicity. </li>
    <li>When prescribing antidepressants, antipsychotics, or lithium to patients at risk for suicide, it is important to pay attention to the risk of overdose and limit the amount of medication dispensed. </li>
    <li>Clozapine's adverse effect profile is not benign as it has strong anticholinergic properties, is associated with metabolic effects including weight gain and glucose intolerance, sialorrhea, agranulocytosis, and myocarditis. </li>
    <li>Patients started or who are managed with antiepileptics should be monitored for changes in behavior and the emergence of suicidal thoughts. </li>
    <li>Benzodiazepines can be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, hypervigilance, and other anxiety symptoms. In general, benzodiazepines are not recommended for long-term use in chronic aggression because of the potential for dependence and tolerance, resulting in an increase in impulsivity-aggression. Benzodiazepines can occasionally disinhibit aggressive and dangerous behaviors and enhance impulsivity. Benzodiazepines taken in excessive amounts can cause overdose and dangerous deep unconsciousness. In combination with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for toxicity increases exponentially. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Qualifying Statements</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and The Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines are based upon the best information available at the time of publication. They are designed to provide information and assist decision-making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. </li>
    <li>Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when providers take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every health care professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. </li>
    <li>After assessing evidence quality for suicide prevention, researchers concluded, "there is a lack of strong evidence for any interventions in preventing suicide and suicide attempts." Two core challenges markedly diminish quality of evidence in suicide prevention research: difficulty conducting randomized controlled trials, and low base rates of suicide and suicide attempts, even in groups at higher risk for suicide. </li>
</ul></p>

            </div>
                <h2 id="434" class="accordion-title section-434 is-active" role="tab" aria-expanded="true"><a href="#">Implementation of the Guideline</a></h2>
            <div class="accordion-panel is-active" role="tabpanel">
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>While these clinical practice guidelines propose potentially universal approaches for enhancing accurate assessment of risk for suicide and effective prevention of deaths by suicide, their implementation is intended for the unique government environments of Military and Veteran medical systems. Such uniqueness includes the evolution over the past several years of considerable investments to prevent suicide at multiple levels of each Department. Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) suicide preventionists have co-presented academic research on suicide prevention at each Department's mental health/suicide prevention conferences. VA/DoD subject matter experts attend the monthly DoD Suicide Prevention and Risk Reduction Committee (SPARRC) meetings to coordinate and share initiatives. A common VA/DoD suicide prevention website was developed and hosted (<a href="/web/20180712194712/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=47023&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.suicideoutreach.org" title="Suicide Outreach Web site">http://www.suicideoutreach.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712194712im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). In addition, VA clinicians increasingly provided both preventive and medical care to Reserve Component Service members. For example, VA providers address suicide prevention while conducting post-deployment health assessments (including mental health) for Reserve Component Service members returning from combat deployments. Additionally, Congress extended the eligibility for health care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to five years from discharge or separation date from active duty and activated members of the National Guard and Reserve who served in Operations Iraqi or Enduring Freedom (OEF/OIF/OND), leading to many Service members receiving their routine and behavioral health care in VHA facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong></p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report <em>Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance Use Conditions</em> documents the wide variations and problems in training all categories of mental health professionals. This IOM report describes the remarkable inadequacies of curricula, course design, and continuing education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a shortage of clinicians trained to provide evidence-based psychotherapies. Some experts believe that until clinical training programs for the major mental health disciplines include training in these evidence-based therapies, the gap between research and clinical practice will remain.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Training in suicide risk assessment and management of patients who self-harm should be a core competency for all providers. It should be an essential component of prequalification training. </li>
    <li>Providers who are exposed to people who harm themselves should have access to experienced colleagues for consultation and assistance in management of difficult cases. </li>
    <li>Primary Care and General Medical Care providers should have access to Behavioral Health experts in evaluation and managing patient at risk for suicide. </li>
</ul></div></p>
