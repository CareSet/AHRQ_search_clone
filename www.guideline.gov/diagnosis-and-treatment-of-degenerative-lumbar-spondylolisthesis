<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis and Imaging</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Most Appropriate Historical and Physical Examination Findings Consistent with the Diagnosis of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>In the absence of evidence to address this question, it is the work group's opinion that obtaining an accurate history and physical examination is important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Formulating appropriate clinical questions is essential to obtaining an accurate history that can be used in developing a treatment plan for patients. <em>Maintained from original guideline with minor word modifications; Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>In patients with imaging evidence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, the following clinical characteristics have been reported: asymptomatic with only occasional back pain; chronic low back pain with or without radicular symptoms and with or without positional variance; radicular symptoms with or without neurologic deficit, with or without back pain; and intermittent neurogenic claudication. The summaries in the original guideline document are provided as background support to help further define the clinical characteristics that may be associated with a diagnosis of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Most Appropriate Diagnostic Tests for Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>The lateral radiograph is the most appropriate, noninvasive test for detecting degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Maintained from original guideline with minor word modifications; </em><em>Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)</em></p>
<p>In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that the lateral radiograph should be obtained in the standing position whenever possible. <em>New consensus statement; Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>The most appropriate, noninvasive test for imaging the stenosis accompanying degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <em>Maintained from original guideline; Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>Facet joint effusion greater than 1.5 mm on supine MRI may be suggestive of the presence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Further evaluation for the presence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis should be considered, including using plain standing radiographs. <em>New recommendation statement; Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the utility of the upright seated MRI in the diagnosis of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>New recommendation statement; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of axial loaded MRI to evaluate the dural sac cross sectional area in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. <em>New recommendation statement; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>Plain myelography or computed tomography (CT) myelography is useful studies to assess spinal stenosis in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis especially in those who have contraindications to MRI. <em>Maintained from original guideline; Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)</em></p>
<p>In patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis with associated spinal stenosis for whom MRI is either contraindicated or inconclusive, CT myelography is suggested as the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve root impingement. <em>New Consensus Statement; Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p>In patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis with associated spinal stenosis for whom MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated, inconclusive or inappropriate, CT is suggested as the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve room impingement. <em>New Consensus Statement; Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Most Appropriate Diagnostic or Physical Exam Tests Consistent with the Diagnosis of Fixed versus Dynamic Deformity?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the most appropriate diagnostic or physical exam test consistent with fixed or dynamic deformity in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis patients due to the lack of uniform reference standards which define instability.</p>
<p>There is no universally accepted standard to diagnose fixed versus dynamic spondylolisthesis. To evaluate instability, many studies employ the use of lateral flexion extension radiographs, which may be done in the standing or recumbent position; however, there is wide variation in the definition of instability. To assist the readers, the definitions for instability (when provided) in degenerative spondylolisthesis patients, are provided in the original guideline document. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Is Dynamic MRI and/or Dynamic CT Myelography Imaging (Including Standing Imaging, Imaging with Axial Loading) Helpful in the Diagnostic Testing for Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the utility of dynamic MRI and dynamic CT myelography in the diagnosis of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcome Measures for Medical/Interventional and Surgical Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Appropriate Outcome Measures for the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>An updated literature search was not conducted. For more information on appropriate outcome measures for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, the North American Spine Society (NASS) has a publication entitled Compendium of Outcome Instruments for Assessment and Research of Spinal Disorders.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medical and Interventional Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p>An updated systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address any of the medical/interventional treatment questions from the original guideline posed below:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What is the role of pharmacological treatment in the management of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? </li>
    <li>What is the role of physical therapy/exercise in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? </li>
    <li>What is the role of manipulation in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? </li>
    <li>What is the role of ancillary treatments such as bracing, traction, electrical stimulation and transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? </li>
    <li>What is the long-term result (4+ years) of medical/interventional management of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Is the Role of Injections for the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of injections for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>New recommendation statement; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>Medical/interventional treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, when the radicular symptoms of stenosis predominate, most logically should be similar to treatment for symptomatic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. <em>Consensus Statement maintained from original guideline; Work Group Consensus Statement</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surgical Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Does Surgical Decompression Alone Improve Surgical Outcomes in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to Medical/Interventional Treatment Alone?</strong></p>
<p>Direct surgical decompression may be considered for the treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis associated with low grade degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis whose symptoms have been recalcitrant to a trial of medical/interventional treatment. <em>Updated recommendation statement; Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of indirect surgical decompression for the treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis associated with low grade degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis whose symptoms have been recalcitrant to a trial of medical/interventional treatment. <em>Maintained from original guideline; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Does the Addition of Lumbar Fusion, with or without Instrumentation, to Surgical Decompression Improve Surgical Outcomes in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to Treatment by Decompression Alone?</strong></p>
<p>Surgical decompression with fusion is suggested for the treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis to improve clinical outcomes compared with decompression alone. <em>Maintained from original guideline with minor word modifications; Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>For symptomatic single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis that is low-grade (&lt;20%) and without lateral foraminal stenosis, decompression alone with preservation of midline structures provide equivalent outcomes when compared to surgical decompression with fusion. <em>New recommendation statement; Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)</em></p>
<p><strong>Does the Addition of Lumbar Fusion, with or without Instrumentation, to Surgical Decompression Improve Surgical Outcomes in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to Medical/Interventional Treatment Alone?</strong></p>
<p>Surgical decompression with fusion, with or without instrumentation, is suggested to improve the functional outcomes of single-level degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis compared to medical/interventional treatment alone. <em>Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against efficacy of surgical decompression with fusion, with or without instrumentation, for treatment of multi-level degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis compared to medical/interventional treatment alone. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Does the Addition of Instrumentation to Decompression and Fusion for Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Improve Surgical Outcomes Compared with Decompression and Fusion Alone?</strong></p>
<p>The addition of instrumentation is suggested to improve fusion rates in patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Maintained from original guideline with minor word modifications; Grade of Recommendation: B</em></p>
<p>The addition of instrumentation is not suggested to improve clinical outcomes for the treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Maintained from original guideline with minor word modifications; Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)</em></p>
<p><strong>How Do Outcomes of Decompression with Posterolateral Fusion Compare with Those for 360&deg; Fusion in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this guideline, the work group defined "360&deg; fusion" as a procedure involving interbody fusion.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of either decompression with posterolateral fusion or 360&deg; fusion in the surgical treatment of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Maintained from original guideline; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Does 360&deg; Fusion with Decompression Lead to Better Outcomes versus 360&deg; Fusion without Decompression for Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>No evidence was found to address this question. Due to the paucity of literature addressing this question, the work group was unable to generate a recommendation to answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>Do Flexible Fusions Improve Outcomes in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to Nonoperative Treatment?</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this guideline, the work group defined "flexible fusion" as a procedure involving dynamic stabilization without arthrodesis.</p>
<p>No evidence was found to address this question. Due to the paucity of literature addressing this question, the work group was unable to generate a recommendation to answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Use of Interspinous Spacers in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Improve Outcomes Compared to Medical/Interventional Treatment?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient and conflicting evidence to make a recommendation for or against the efficacy of interspinous spacers versus medical/ interventional treatment in the management of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis patients. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Role of Reduction (Deliberate Attempt to Reduce via Surgical Technique) with Fusion in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of reduction with fusion in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Revised wording, but Recommendation Grade maintained; Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>The updated literature search did not retrieve new evidence to support a recommendation for or against the use of reduction with fusion; therefore, the work group maintains the original guideline's "Insufficient Recommendation" grading. Although reduction and fusion can be performed, the evidence reviewed does not substantiate any improvement in clinical outcomes and reduction may increase the risk of neurological complications.</p>
<p><strong>For Patients Undergoing Posterolateral Fusion, Does the Use of Autogenous Bone Graft Improve Surgical Outcomes Compared to Those Fused with Bone Graft Substitutes?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the paucity of literature addressing this question, the work group was unable to generate a recommendation to answer this question.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of autogenous bone graft or bone graft substitutes in patients undergoing posterolateral fusion for the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>Do Minimally Invasive Surgical Treatments Improve Outcomes in the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><strong>Conventional open decompression (laminectomy)?</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>Conventional (open) lumbar decompression and fusion, with or without instrumentation?</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>No evidence was found to assess the efficacy of minimally invasive surgical techniques versus open decompression alone in the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.</p>
<p>While both minimally invasive techniques and open decompression and fusion, with or without instrumentation, demonstrate significantly improved clinical outcomes for the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, there is conflicting evidence which technique leads to better outcomes. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient/Conflicting Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Long-term Result (4 or More Years) of Surgical Management of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>Decompression and fusion may be considered as a means to provide satisfactory long-term results for the treatment of patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Maintained from original guideline with minor word modifications; Grade of Recommendation: C</em></p>
<p><strong>Which Patient-specific Characteristics Influence Outcomes (and Prognosis) in the Treatment (Surgical or Any) of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the influence of a nonorganic pain drawing on the outcomes/prognosis of treatments for patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the influence of age and three or more comorbidities on the outcomes of patients undergoing treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the influence of symptom duration on the treatment outcomes of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the influence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;30) and its impact on treatment outcomes in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Effect of Postsurgical Rehabilitation Including Exercise, Spinal Mobilization/Manipulation or Psychosocial Interventions on Outcomes in the Management of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis (Compared to Patients Who Do Not Undergo Postsurgical Rehabilitation)?</strong></p>
<p>There was no evidence found to address this question. Due to the paucity of evidence, a recommendation cannot be made regarding the effect of postsurgical rehabilitation the outcomes of patients undergoing surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Value of Spine Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Cost-effectiveness of the Surgical Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to Medical/Interventional Treatment (Consider with and without Fusion Separately)?</strong></p>
<p>There was no evidence found to address this question. Due to the paucity of evidence, a recommendation cannot be made regarding the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment compared to medical/interventional treatment for the management of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Cost-effectiveness of Minimal Access-based Surgical Treatments of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Compared to Traditional Open Surgical Treatments?</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the cost-effectiveness of minimal access-based surgical treatments compared to traditional open surgical treatments for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. <em>Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence)</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Recommendation for Summaries or Reviews of Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Good evidence (Level I studies with consistent findings) for or against recommending intervention.</p>

<p>The clinical questions from the original guideline, published in 2008, are included in this guideline update. Since 2008, an additional section addressing value in spine care has been added. Trained guideline participants were asked to submit a list of new additional clinical questions that the guideline should address in addition to the questions included in the original guideline. The lists of new questions were compiled into a master list, which was then circulated to each member with a request that they independently rank the questions in order of importance for consideration in the guideline. The questions from the previous guideline and most highly ranked new questions, as determined by the participants, served to focus the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identification of Search Terms and Parameters</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the most crucial elements of evidence analysis is the comprehensive literature search. Thorough assessment of the literature is the basis for the review of existing evidence and the formulation of evidence-based recommendations. In order to ensure a thorough literature search, the North American Spine Society (NASS) has instituted a Literature Search Protocol (see Appendix E in the original guideline document) which has been followed to identify literature for evaluation in guideline development. In keeping with the Literature Search Protocol, work group members have identified appropriate search terms and parameters to direct the literature search. Specific search strategies, including search terms, parameters and databases searched, are documented in the technical report that accompanies this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Completion of the Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>Once each work group identified search terms/parameters, the literature search was implemented by a medical/research librarian at InfoNOW at the University of Minnesota, consistent with the Literature Search Protocol. Following these protocols ensures that NASS recommendations (1) are based on a thorough review of relevant literature; (2) are truly based on a uniform, comprehensive search strategy; and (3) represent the current best research evidence available. NASS maintains a search history in Endnote, for future use or reference.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The guideline is based on a systematic review of the evidence. The updated literature search was conducted in May 2013.</p>
<p><em>Databases Searched</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medline/PubMed </li>
    <li>The Cochrane Library </li>
    <li>EMBASE </li>
</ul>
<p>Article reference lists were also searched. Duplicate records were eliminated.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Humans </li>
    <li>English language </li>
    <li>Addresses clinical question </li>
    <li>If mixed diagnosis study, results must include subgroup analysis of outcomes for degenerative spondylolisthesis patients only </li>
    <li>Date range for revised questions: January 2007 to May 2013 </li>
    <li>Date range for new questions: All literature to May 2013 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review of Search Results/Identification of Literature to Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Work group members reviewed all abstracts yielded from the literature search and identified the literature they will review in order to address the clinical questions, in accordance with the Literature Search Protocol. Members have identified the best research evidence available to answer the targeted clinical questions. That is, if Level I, II and or III literature is available to answer specific questions, the work group was not required to review Level IV or V studies.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Members have independently developed evidentiary tables summarizing study conclusions, identifying strengths and weaknesses and assigning levels of evidence. In order to systematically control for potential biases, at least two work group members have reviewed each article selected and independently assigned levels of evidence to the literature using the North American Spine Society (NASS) levels of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Any discrepancies in scoring have been addressed by two or more reviewers. Final ratings are completed at a final meeting of all section workgroup members including the section chair and the guideline chair. The consensus level (the level upon which two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement) was then assigned to the article.</p>
<p>As a final step in the evidence analysis process, members have identified and documented gaps in the evidence to educate guideline readers about where evidence is lacking and help guide further needed research by NASS and other societies.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>In evaluating studies as to levels of evidence for this guideline, the study design was interpreted as establishing only a potential level of evidence. As an example, a therapeutic study designed as a randomized controlled trial would be considered a potential Level I study. The study would then be further analyzed as to how well the study design was implemented and significant shortcomings in the execution of the study would be used to downgrade the levels of evidence for the study's conclusions. In the example cited previously, reasons to downgrade the results of a potential Level I randomized controlled trial to a Level II study would include, among other possibilities: an underpowered study (patient sample too small, variance too high), inadequate randomization or masking of the group assignments and lack of validated outcome measures.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of studies were reviewed several times in answering different questions within this guideline. How a given question was asked might influence how a study was evaluated and interpreted as to its level of evidence in answering that particular question. For example, a randomized controlled trial reviewed to evaluate the differences between the outcomes of surgically treated versus untreated patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy might be a well designed and implemented Level I therapeutic study. This same study, however, might be classified as providing Level II prognostic evidence if the data for the untreated controls were extracted and evaluated prognostically.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Identification of Work Groups</strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams were assigned to work groups and assigned specific clinical questions to address. Because North American Spine Society (NASS) is comprised of surgical, medical and interventional specialists, it is imperative to the guideline development process that a cross- section of NASS membership is represented on the work group. This also helps to ensure that the potential for inadvertent biases in evaluating the literature and formulating recommendations is minimized.</p>
<p><strong>Formulation of Evidence-Based Recommendations and Incorporation of Expert Consensus</strong></p>
<p>Work groups held web conferences and face-to-face meetings to discuss the evidence-based answers to the clinical questions, the grades of recommendations and the incorporation of expert consensus. Work group members incorporated evidence findings from the original guideline in the guideline update. Where there was no new evidence, the work group re-reviewed the original literature and recommendation statements to ensure agreement with original findings. When new literature was found, work group members included existing evidence when updating recommendations statements.</p>
<p>Expert consensus was incorporated only where Level I-IV evidence is insufficient and the work group has deemed that a recommendation is warranted. Transparency in the incorporation of consensus is crucial, and all consensus-based recommendations made in this guideline very clearly indicate that Level I-IV evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation and that the recommendation is based only on expert consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Development Process</strong></p>
<p>Voting on guideline recommendations was conducted using a modification of the nominal group technique in which each work group member independently and anonymously ranked a recommendation on a scale ranging from 1 ("extremely inappropriate") to 9 ("extremely appropriate"). Consensus was obtained when at least 80% of work group members ranked the recommendation as 7, 8 or 9. When the 80% threshold was not attained, up to three rounds of discussion and voting were held to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not resolved after these rounds, no recommendation was adopted.</p>
<p>After the recommendations were established, work group members developed the guideline content, addressing the literature supporting the recommendations.</p></div></p>
