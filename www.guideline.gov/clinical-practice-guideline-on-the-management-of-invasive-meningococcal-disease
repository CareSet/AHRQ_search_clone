<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis of Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Warning Signs and Symptoms or Red Flag</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In paediatric patients who come to primary health care (or emergency), what set of signs and symptoms should arouse suspicion of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD)?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Fever </li>
        <li>Neck stiffness </li>
        <li>Headache </li>
        <li>Photophobia </li>
        <li>Vomiting </li>
        <li>Dizziness </li>
        <li>Fast breathing </li>
        <li>Drowsiness </li>
        <li>Less than 50% of usual fluid intake in 24 hours (&lt;1 year) </li>
        <li>Strange pitched cry (&lt;1 year) </li>
        <li>Abnormal skin colour (pale, earthy, mottled, bluish) </li>
        <li>Vascular collapse, hypotension, shock </li>
        <li>Leg pain or refusal to walk </li>
        <li>Rash </li>
        <li>Changes in heart rate </li>
        <li>Cold hands and feet </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Health care professionals should be trained on how to recognize and manage IMD.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The presence of a generalized petechial or purpuric rash, with capillary refill &gt;2 seconds in a paediatric patient with impairment of the general condition, should suggest IMD and the need for urgent treatment.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In the ill paediatric patient, the presence of any of the following signs and symptoms should alert the clinician about the possibility of IMD:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Petechial rash (non-blanching) </li>
    <li>Capillary refill time &gt;2 seconds </li>
    <li>Abnormal skin colour </li>
    <li>Decreased level of consciousness </li>
    <li>Pain in extremities </li>
    <li>Cold hands and feet </li>
    <li>Fever </li>
    <li>Headache </li>
    <li>Neck stiffness </li>
    <li>Photophobia </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - One must remain alert to the possibility of IMD when evaluating patients with acute febrile disease because in the first 4 to 6 hours of onset of the clinical IMD nonspecific symptoms such as fever, lethargy, refusal of food, nausea, vomiting, irritability, signs and/or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (runny nose, sore throat, etc.), diarrhoea, or abdominal pain may appear.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In the initial clinical evaluation (primary care), it should be noted that the following symptoms are very rare in the paediatric patient with mild febrile disease: leg pain, confusion, neck stiffness, and photophobia.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The clinician will take into account the fact that the signs and symptoms of the disease can vary and become more specific over time.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The set of clinical and laboratory findings which strongly suggest that the causal agent of bacterial meningitis is <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> includes the presence of haemorrhagic rash + absence of seizures + headache + negative gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Reassessment as Strategy to Improve Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Questions to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For a paediatric patient who goes to primary health care with symptoms suggestive of IMD, does a second specific clinical evaluation (after 4 to 6 hours) for disease progression improve the diagnosis? </li>
    <li>For a paediatric patient who goes to primary health care with symptoms suggestive of IMD, does a telephone evaluation for disease progression improve the diagnosis? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In the presence of clinical signs or other symptoms suggestive of IMD, treatment should not be delayed waiting for a second clinical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Children with nonspecific symptoms at initial presentation, in whom IMD cannot be excluded at the discretion of the physician, should be reassessed in a short period of time (hours).</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The health care professional will inform caregivers about the need to seek health care if the patient's condition deteriorates during childhood before the planned revaluation for example, if the characteristics of the rash change. The degree of concern of parents or caregivers as well as their ability to act if the patient worsens must be taken into account and information on the availability of health services in the area must be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Non-specific Laboratory Tests</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Among paediatric population with petechial rash, can non-specific laboratory tests (C-reactive protein [CRP], white cell count, blood gases), help to confirm or refute the diagnosis of IMD? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The following determinations should be performed in children with petechial rash of unknown origin and fever, or history of fever:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Blood cell counts </li>
    <li>CRP or procalcitonin </li>
    <li>Coagulation tests </li>
    <li>Blood culture </li>
    <li>Blood glucose </li>
    <li>Pulse oximetry </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong> - If a paediatric patient has a petechial rash of unknown origin and fever, or history of fever, but none of the high-risk clinical features, the following recommendations should be considered:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Start the specific treatment immediately if the CRP or the white cell count (especially neutrophil count) is high, since this indicates increased risk of IMD. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should be aware that although IMD is less likely with both normal CRP and white cell count, it should not be ruled out. Both parameters can be normal in severe or very short evolution cases. </li>
    <li>Evaluate clinical progression by monitoring vital signs, capillary refill time and oxygen saturation. Perform checks at least every hour for the next 4 to 6 hours. </li>
    <li>Treat with antibiotics and admit to hospital if doubt persists. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The serum procalcitonin concentration can be used as an early marker of IMD. Changes in the serum concentration of procalcitonin take place earlier and faster than those of the CRP.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - If the final assessment is as being of low risk of IMD and the patient is discharged, it is recommended to warn caregivers to return if they feel that he/she worsens (for example, if new spots appear or if the patient seems excessively sleepy or irritable).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Increased Intracranial Pressure</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Among paediatric population with suspected or confirmed bacterial meningitis, can a cranial computed tomography (CT) reliably demonstrate an increase of intracranial pressure? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Clinical assessment, and not cranial CT, is recommended to decide whether it is safe to perform a lumbar puncture. CT is unreliable for identifying increased intracranial pressure.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If a CT has been performed, it is not recommended to do a lumbar puncture if there are radiological signs of increased intracranial pressure.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommended not to delay the treatment while waiting for a CT to be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Microbiological Confirmation Tests</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In the case of patients with suspected IMD, what diagnostic tests done at an early stage are useful to confirm the diagnosis of IMD?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Blood culture </li>
        <li>Skin scrapings </li>
        <li>Blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </li>
        <li>Throat swab </li>
        <li>Urine rapid antigen testing </li>
        <li>Blood rapid antigen testing </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong> - To confirm the diagnosis in patients with suspected IMD, blood should be drawn for bacterial culture.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - To confirm the diagnosis in patients with suspected IMD, blood should be drawn to perform a meningococcal PCR (whole blood, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) in laboratories with sufficient technical capacity.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - A lumbar puncture should be performed in patients with clinical features of meningitis without sepsis (purpura), if there are no contraindications.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The CSF should be referred to a microbiological laboratory. The following techniques should be performed:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Microscopy </li>
    <li>Cultivation of bacteria </li>
    <li>Meningococcal PCR in laboratories with sufficient technical capacity </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - None of the following techniques is definitive when IMD is to be confirmed or ruled out: skin scraping, skin biopsy, petechial or purpuric lesion aspirates (obtained with a needle and syringe).</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Samples should be collected as soon as possible after establishing the clinical suspicion and preferably before starting the antimicrobial treatment. The sample collection must not delay the onset of the antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-hospital Management of IMD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pre-hospital Administration of Antibiotics</strong></p>
<p><em>Questions to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD, does the pre-hospital administration of antibiotics reduce mortality? </li>
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD, does the pre-hospital administration of antibiotics affect morbidity and influence the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), the duration of hospital stay, admission costs, the duration of school absence, etc.? </li>
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD who come to primary health care, does the parenteral administration of antibiotics reduce mortality and morbidity more than the oral administration of antibiotics? </li>
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD who come to primary health care, does the intramuscular administration of ceftriaxone have a similar efficacy and safety to its intravenous administration? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Patients with suspected IMD will be sent to hospital urgently.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When suspecting IMD, intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV or IM) should be administered as soon as possible, both in primary care and at a higher level, but the urgent transfer to hospital should not be delayed.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-hospital Resuscitation</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD, does resuscitation before reaching the hospital (in the ambulance) improve survival? Can they reduce the severity of the disease and influence on the admission to the ICU, the duration of hospital stay, admission costs or the duration of school absence? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - In patients with suspected or confirmed meningococcal sepsis, resuscitation should be started immediately, if possible, prior to initiating patient transport or during transport.</p>
<p><strong>Development and Implementation of Protocols</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Do care processes ("process mapping programs") for those patients with progressive symptoms improve survival or reduce the severity of the disease? Do these have any effect on the admission to the ICU or the duration of hospital stay, admission costs, the duration of school absence, etc.? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - It is recommended to develop tools locally (clinical pathways, process maps, interdisciplinary agreements) to facilitate access and care of patients with IMD, taking into account the geography and the services available.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A periodic revision of the medical records of patients with IMD is recommended to identify avoidable situations and achieve optimal health care.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hospital Management of IMD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Questions to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What antibiotic regimen should be used to treat bacterial meningitis or confirmed meningococcal septicaemia? </li>
    <li>In patients with IMD, is a short treatment (&le;7 days) as effective or more and as safe as or more to than a prolonged treatment (&gt;7 days) to maintain or increase the cure rate of the disease and maintain or reduce the number of sequelae? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> - First-line antibiotics for the treatment of confirmed IMD are intravenous ceftriaxone every 12 hours for a total of 7 days, or cefotaxime, every 6 hours for a total of 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling for Microbiological Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD treated at a hospital emergency unit, should the antibiotic treatment start immediately or should it start after the realization of the lumbar puncture and blood culture? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In a hospital emergency unit, when suspecting a case of IMD, obtaining samples from the patient for further confirmation of the diagnosis should not delay the beginning of the empirical antibiotic treatment.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Blood cultures should be performed as soon as possible, but should not delay treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Indications for Lumbar Puncture in IMD</strong></p>
<p><em>Questions to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD, does lumbar puncture (early/late) affect the early/late onset of the specific treatment, the final diagnosis, as well as morbidity and mortality rates? </li>
    <li>Among paediatric population less than three months of age with bacterial meningitis, should a control lumbar puncture be done before stopping the antibiotic treatment? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Lumbar puncture is not recommended in the initial evaluation for suspected IMD with features of septicaemia. Late realization of the lumbar puncture may be considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain or there is inadequate clinical progression and no contraindications.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Lumbar puncture should be performed in patients with clinical meningitis without septicemic features (purpura) if there are no contraindications.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The CSF will be sent to the laboratory for microscopy, culture and PCR.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In paediatric patients who are clinically well and without evidence of bacterial disease, it is reasonable to observe the patient and defer the realization of the lumbar puncture.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is advisable to repeat the lumbar puncture in paediatric patients aged between 1 and 3 months who have not been previously hospitalized in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Presence of persistent or recurrent fever </li>
    <li>Deterioration of the clinical condition </li>
    <li>New clinical findings (especially neurological) or persistently altered inflammatory reactants </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is not advisable to perform lumbar puncture to assess the success of treatment in paediatric patients aged between 1 and 3 months not previously hospitalized in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In the case of patients receiving adequate antibiotic treatment against the causative agent, and whose clinical outcome is still good </li>
    <li>Before stopping antibiotic treatment if clinical response is good </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Early Supportive Therapy</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with suspected IMD, do the following treatments reduce mortality and morbidity?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Corticosteroid therapy </li>
        <li>Intravenous fluids to debate: colloid/crystalloid (Hartmann normal saline, Ringer's lactate), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), artificial colloids </li>
        <li>Resuscitation (oxygen, airway care and circulatory system) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong> - The adjuvant administration of a corticosteroid (dexamethasone intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/dose up to 10 mg/dose, 4 times a day for 4 days) should be considered when there is a suspicion of bacterial meningitis or once it has been confirmed; it should be administered as soon as possible and it should not interfere with the administration of antibiotics and the transfer to a specialized centre.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Do not administer corticosteroids to paediatric patients with meningococcal septicaemia, except in cases of meningococcal septic shock resistant to catecholamine.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In patients with suspected or confirmed bacterial meningitis, the appearance of signs of shock, increased intracranial pressure and dehydration will be assessed.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The administration of fluids should not be restricted unless there is increased intracranial pressure or an increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - A volume of fluids should be administered and maintained to avoid hypoglycaemia and maintain the electrolyte balance.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Use enteral feeds as maintenance fluid if tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If it is necessary to maintain intravenous fluids, the use of isotonic fluids (0.9% sodium chloride with 5% glucose, or 0.9% sodium chloride with 5% dextrose) is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The administration of fluids and urine output should be monitored to ensure adequate hydration and prevent over-hydration.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Electrolytes and glucose should be monitored regularly (if intravenous liquids are administered at least once a day).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If there are signs of increased intracranial pressure or shock, it is recommended to start the emergency procedures relevant to these situations and discuss the management of fluids with a paediatric intensive care physician.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If there are signs of shock, give immediately 20 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride in 5 to 10 minutes. Give the fluid intravenously or via an intraosseous route and reassess the patient immediately (see table, "Management of Paediatric Patients with IMD: Intravenous Fluid," below).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In self-ventilating children with suspected bacterial meningitis or confirmed meningococcal septicaemia, and signs of respiratory distress, the use of a facial mask is recommended to provide 15 litres of oxygen through a mask with reservoir (see table, "Management of Respiratory Support in Paediatric Patients with IMD," below). If there is a threat of loss of airway patency, airway opening manoeuvres should be applied; positive pressure ventilation through a mask ventilation bag and finally isolation of the airway.</p>

        <li>Corticosteroids, high-dose or physiological replacement </li>
        <li>Invasive management of intracranial hypertension </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Catecholamines are recommended at an early stage to manage patients with fluid resistant meningococcal septic shock and the support with mechanical ventilation should be considered for these patients.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - In patients with meningococcal septic shock resistant to catecholamine, intravenous terlipressin and titrated doses of corticosteroids are considered proper rescue measures.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Paediatric patients with meningococcal septic shock resistant to catecholamines could benefit from the use of terlipressin as a rescue therapy.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Non-invasive monitoring (electrocardiogram [ECG], blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation) of patients with fluid sensitive meningococcal septic shock is recommended. A central access (arterial or venous) will be channelled in cases of fluid resistant meningococcal septic.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to IMD who do not respond to standard therapy may benefit from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Patients with fluid resistant meningococcal septic shock, severe metabolic acidosis, acute or impending renal failure, and complex or problematic fluid balance, may benefit from continuous veno-venous haemofiltration.</p>

<p><strong>Surgical Management of IMD</strong></p>
<p><em>Questions to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with extensive skin affection, do compartment pressure control and fasciotomy reduce the number and extension of tissue necrosis, amputations and degree of residual disability? </li>
    <li>In patients with IMD and complications, what is more effective and safe to reduce tissue necrosis or prevent amputation or secondary infection: early surgical debridement or the conservative treatment? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Monitoring of compartmental pressure in patients with IMD and extensive vascular involvement of a limb should be considered.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - It is necessary to resort to a specialist urgently to assess and interpret the monitoring of compartmental pressure.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Urgent debridement is recommended if secondary infections of the wound appear in the paediatric patient, if the situation allows.</p>

    <li>In patients with suspected IMD, are measures such as the isolation in an individual room, the use of individual protection equipment (non-sterile clean gloves, non-sterile clean gown, waterproof mask, eye or facial protector) and chemoprophylaxis, effective in hospital care to reduce the risk of secondary infection associated to health care by clinical staff (except laboratory staff), family or people living with the index case? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Paediatric patients with suspected IMD should be initially admitted to a single room.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When a suspected case of IMD is admitted to hospital, droplet transmission precautions should be taken, which can be interrupted after 24 hours of effective treatment of the patient.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Health care staff at high risk of exposure to respiratory secretions must use appropriate individual protective equipment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-up after IMD</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sequelae Associated to IMD and Support to Patients, Family and Caregivers</strong></p>
<p><em>Questions to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What are the sequelae associated to IMD and what aspects need greater support and information for patients and their families and caregivers? </li>
    <li>What proportion of the paediatric population with bacterial meningitis develops physical or psychological morbidity? </li>
    <li>What proportion of the paediatric population with meningococcal septicaemia develops physical or psychological morbidity? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The patient who has suffered IMD must leave the hospital with an individualized care plan.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The individualized care plan for patients who have suffered IMD shall describe the monitoring to be performed in order to identify immediate complications that may occur in the long term. Furthermore, the individualized care plan shall include an extensive list of professionals, schools, associations, foundations and institutions that can help the patient affected and his/her families to manage their new life, not forgetting to include those public or private institutions, which can provide financial assistance.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The patient who has suffered from IMD and their families should be informed of the following potential long-term consequences:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Hearing loss </li>
    <li>Orthopaedic sequelae (damage to bones or joints) </li>
    <li>Skin lesions (scarring from necrosis) </li>
    <li>Psychosocial issues </li>
    <li>Neurological and developmental disorders </li>
    <li>Renal failure </li>
</ul>
<p>They should be informed of the characteristics of the disease, its prevalence, case fatality, morbidity, and the usual means of transmission, etc., to try to minimize the guilt that usually appears in all those people closely involved with the patient.</p>
<p>The individualized care plan shall include delivery to the family of a free printed copy of this clinical practice guideline (CPG) in its version for patients, families and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Hearing and neurologic tests should be performed to any patient who has suffered IMD, in order to establish a treatment as soon as possible if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Before discharge, the family should be offered the possibility to acquire the appropriate skills to engage with the basic care of the paediatric patient.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When the patient is far from the hospital, the opportunity to acquire skills related to specialized care should be offered.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Providing the family with psychological support will help them to decide and mitigate the intensity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if it appears.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - Health care professionals should be offered the means to enable them to acquire effective communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on Families and Caregivers</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Do families and caregivers of those who have suffered IMD suffer any psychosocial problems? And, if so, do the psychosocial interventions and supply of information improve their quality of life? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Health care professionals involved in the monitoring of paediatric patients with IMD should be aware of the possibility of PTSD with anxiety or depression in patients, their families and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - It is recommended that a psychologist or psychotherapist monitors in the short-term (up to 2 years) patients with IMD and their parents in the weeks following the discharge from the paediatric ICU, or if the patient dies, in order to reduce the scope of the psychological sequelae of the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness and Information Campaigns on IMD</strong></p>
<p><em>Question to Answer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Do the educational programs aimed at health professionals and the population in general improve the speed of recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of IMD? Do they increase survival or decrease the severity of the disease and its complications? Do they have any effect on the admission to the ICU or the duration of hospital stay, admission costs, the duration of school absence, etc.? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The general population and other groups (such as pharmaceuticals, day carers, etc.) should be informed about IMD in order to suspect the disease at an early stage.</p>
<p><strong>GCP</strong> - The general population should know the implications of the appearance of petechiae for early detection of the IMD.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The creation and selection of the clinical questions was conducted based on questions that address controversial issues in other guides, that is, questions which require a thorough review by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) to identify the latest advances in materials, as well as questions that have arisen within the GDG itself, until a total of thirty-eight questions related to epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and monitoring of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) among the population described. The development of the clinical questions was conducted considering the PICO (Patient/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome) format.</p>
<p>The next step was to conduct an initial literature search in databases and other specialized sources (Medline, EMBASE, Excelencia Cl&iacute;nica, Trip Database, Gu&iacute;aSalud, National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), Guidelines International Network-GIN), in order to locate other clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), national or international, dealing with similar topics.</p>
<p>This search resulted in the location of five guides, two of which were discarded because the population, topics, interventions, completion date or methodology did not meet the aims and scope of this CPG. The three remaining guides were evaluated, using the AGREE instrument (Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation). All of them met the minimum requirement previously established to be a source of evidence in this guide: achieving a score above 65% in terms of rigour of development.</p>
<p>Two guides have become secondary sources of evidence to answer several clinical questions, and it is indicated so in the different sections of this document where the conclusions or studies extracted from them have been set out. To adapt and update the evidence from the above guidelines, the methodology proposed by Osteba in its "Informe de Evaluaci&oacute;n sobre Descripci&oacute;n de la Metodolog&iacute;a empleada en la GPC sobre Asma" was used. The guide of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) focuses exclusively on the chemoprophylaxis of the contacts of patients with IMD.</p>
<p>For the nineteen clinical questions addressed in this guide, which the CPG Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) already included, searches from 2006 until 2011, during the months between April and August, were carried out to update and adapt those used by SIGN. Likewise, for the thirteen questions already collected by the CPG National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), these were updated with the searches from 2009 until 2011, during the months between April and August, adapting them to those used by NICE. For the six remaining questions, new specific search strategies were developed to expand the search period without a limiting date. Additionally, automatic email alerts were defined for new articles added to Medline (PubMed).</p>
<p>The search strategies were conducted combining terms in controlled language within each database (MeSH, Emtree, and Decs) and free language, in order to improve and balance their sensitivity and specificity. The sources were Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Elsevier.com), Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, Cochrane Library, &Iacute;ndice Bibliogr&aacute;fico Espa&ntilde;ol en Ciencias de la Salud (IBECs) and Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACs).</p>
<p>The searches were based on the most appropriate types of studies in relation to the characteristics of each question and the following languages: Spanish, French, English, Catalan, Italian and Portuguese.</p>
<p>A reverse search of the references of articles identified and included in this guide was carried out. Grey literature was also searched in a non-systematic way.</p>
<p>The search results were peer reviewed; the clinical guide coordinator resolved any discrepancy situations. Initially, screening was done by title and abstract. In a second screening, studies were discarded and the causes of exclusion identified.</p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Population aged between one month and 19 years suspected of having IMD or with confirmed IMD and their contacts. Some questions addressed in this CPG have focused exclusively on paediatric population. </li>
    <li>Infants aged less than one month were excluded because the aetiology and pathogenesis of meningitis and sepsis during this age period are different. </li>
</ol>
<p>Included in the Methodological Material document is a description of the methodology for each question, with a description of the search strategy (information sources, limits, identified studies, included studies, bibliographic searches).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The methodology used in the preparation of this clinical practice guideline (CPG) is set out in the <em>Methodology Manual for Preparation of CPG in the NHS</em>.</p>
<p>The development of this CPG began with the establishment of the Guideline Development Group (GDG), composed of 12 clinicians from diverse health fields: primary and hospital care, and other specialties such as nursing, paediatrics, internal medicine, family and community medicine, paediatric intensive medicine, microbiology, orthopaedics and preventive medicine and public health. Moreover, from the early stages a group of citizens supported by the Irene Meg&iacute;as Foundation against meningitis took part. There were also four additional citizens to review the information for patients, families and caregivers. The review focused on the understandability of the content and identifying the information that they felt should be included in the document.</p>
<p>The critical reading tool from the Agency for Health Technology Assessment of the Basque Country - OSTEBA simplifies the synthesis work of the literature, which, following a review by the GDG, served as material for any development of the recommendations through formal assessment or reasoned judgment. In addition to the volume and quality of evidence, the GDG should consider the applicability of the findings, the correlation of the data and the relevance of its application in our National Health System or its clinical impact. For those clinical questions for which the volume of evidence turned out to be little or none, poor methodological quality (level of evidence 1- and 2-) or inconsistent, recommendations were made based on the consensus of the group that had taken into account, as well as additional factors, others such as routine clinical practice, the availability of intervention in the environment, the benefit-risk ratio or even the data sheet of the drug.</p></div></p>

    <li>The developers of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical practice guideline (CPG) performed a study on cost-effectiveness (for suspected bacterial meningitis or invasive meningococcal disease [IMD]) by comparing penicillin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, and concluded that for patients weighing 37 kg or less, ceftriaxone was the cheapest option; for patients between 37 kg and 51 kg, penicillin and ceftriaxone had similar costs and, for patients weighing more than 51 kg, the administration of penicillin was the cheapest option. They found that, for patients weighing 30 kg or less, penicillin was the most expensive option. Cefotaxime is the antibiotic most used in our environment; according to the NICE CPG an option with an average cost when compared to penicillin and ceftriaxone. </li>
    <li>The development group of the NICE CPG also carried out a cost-effectiveness study of crystalloid vs. colloid resuscitation fluids. The colloid solution was considerably more expensive (&pound;34) than the crystalloid solution (&pound;0.51). The crystalloid solution is considered more cost-effective than the colloid solution. </li>
    <li>In 2005, the Fundaci&oacute;n Hospital Son Ll&agrave;tzer designed a computer protocol on integrated management of sepsis (PIMIS) in adults. Its implementation has resulted in a decrease in both hospital mortality in severe sepsis (11.4%) and septic shock (5.4%), and in a clear decrease in the length of hospital stays and economic cost associated. </li>

Appropriateness of care at every stage of the disease (acute, moderate and sequelae) is critical to achieve a favourable outcome.

                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pre-hospital administration of antibiotics in patients with suspected invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) could delay transport to the hospital and even be the cause of a definitive diagnosis masking. It is a fact that IMD usually progresses rapidly and there is the belief that early administration of an active antibiotic against <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> would affect the reduction of morbidity and mortality. By contrast, it has been suggested that early administration of antibiotics in an environment outside the hospital would cause initial worsening of the IMD due to the bacterial lysis they induce and it would be safer to administer it in hospital. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of intravenous administration of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone include gastrointestinal bleeding, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, fungal infections or high fever. </li>
    <li>The administration of hydrocortisone was associated with an increased risk of new episodes of sepsis or septic shock. </li>
    <li>The optimal volume of fluid to be administered as initial therapy in paediatric patients with bacterial meningitis is unknown. In environments with high mortality and delayed access to health care, fluid restriction appears to increase the risk of neurological sequelae. </li>
    <li>Transportation is a period of high risk and problems can occur, such as endotracheal tube obstruction, loss of venous line or secondary hemodynamic destabilization to movement. It is therefore essential that the transfer is performed by specific paediatric trained staff. </li>
    <li>Terlipressin is a potentially valid alternative rescue treatment for catecholamine-resistant septic shock in paediatric patients. It must be considered that, when associated with high doses of catecholamines, it entails the risk of excessive vasoconstriction and ischemia. </li>
    <li>The administration of ceftriaxone as prophylaxis of IMD increases the risk of nasopharyngeal de novo colonization with respect to rifampicin by 4% after 6 days and 1.5% after 14 days. </li>
