<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevention of Invasive Pneumococcal Infection</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 1</strong></p>
<p>What are the benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotic use in children with SCD? What are the recommended antibiotic administration regimens and schedules?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Administer oral penicillin prophylaxis (125 mg for age &lt;3 years and 250 mg for age &ge;3 years) twice daily until age 5 in all children with homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS). (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Discontinue prophylactic penicillin in children with HbSS at age 5 unless they have had a splenectomy or invasive pneumococcal infection. When discontinuing penicillin prophylaxis at age 5, it is important to assure that the child has completed the recommended pneumococcal vaccination series, and if not, complete the series immediately. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider withholding penicillin prophylaxis from children with hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease and HbS&beta;<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia unless they have had a splenectomy. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assure that people of all ages with SCD have been vaccinated against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.* (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Remind people with SCD, their families, and caregivers to seek immediate medical attention whenever fever (temperature greater than 101.3&deg;F or 38.5&deg;C) occurs, due to the risk for severe bacterial infections. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">*Refer to the "Immunization" section of this chapter in the original guideline document for comprehensive information on immunizations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening for Renal Disease</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 2</strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic individuals with SCD, what is the effect of screening for renal disease, by measuring serum creatinine and urine albumin and protein, on mortality and the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Screen all individuals with SCD, beginning by age 10, for proteinuria. If the result is negative, repeat screening annually. If the result is positive, perform a first morning void urine albumin-creatinine ratio and if abnormal, consult with or refer to a renal specialist. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening for Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 3</strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic individuals with SCD, what is the effect of screening for PH on mortality and the development of future cardiac and pulmonary complications?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Based on the insufficient evidence, the expert panel was unable to make a recommendation for or against screening for PH. However, this does not diminish the importance of evaluating individuals who have symptoms or who have had abnormal echo testing. </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG) Screening</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 4</strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic individuals with SCD, what is the effect of screening with ECG on mortality and the development of future cardiac disease?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Routine ECG screening is not recommended in children and adults with SCD. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening for Hypertension (HTN)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 5</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD, what is the effect of screening for HTN on mortality, stroke, and heart disease? What are the acceptable limits for blood pressure parameters above which cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity occur?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In adults with SCD, screen for HTN and treat to lower systolic blood pressure &le;140 and diastolic blood pressure &le;90 according to "The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" (JNC 7). (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>In children with SCD, measure blood pressure, and evaluate and treat HTN following recommendations from the NHLBI's "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents." (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening for Retinopathy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 6</strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic individuals with SCD, are dilated eye examinations useful, and, if so, with what frequency should they be done?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In people with SCD, refer to an ophthalmologist for a dilated eye examination to evaluate for retinopathy beginning at age 10. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For people having a normal dilated retinal examination, re-screen at 1 to 2 year intervals. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Refer people with suspected retinopathy to a retinal specialist. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening for Risk of Stroke Using Neuroimaging</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 7</strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic individuals with SCD, what is the effect of screening with neuroimaging tests (computed tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or transcranial Doppler [TCD]) on the risk of stroke?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) screen annually with TCD according to methods employed in the Stroke Prevention Trial (STOP) studies, beginning at age 2 and continuing until at least age 16. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In children with conditional (170&ndash;199 cm/sec) or elevated (&gt;200 cm/sec) TCD results, refer to a specialist with expertise in chronic transfusion therapy aimed at preventing stroke. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In children with genotypes other than SCA (e.g., HbS&beta;<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia or HbSC), do not perform screening with TCD. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In asymptomatic children with SCD, do not perform screening with MRI or CT. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>In asymptomatic adults with SCD, do not perform screening with neuroimaging (TCD, MRI, or CT). (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Screening for Pulmonary Disease</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 8</strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic individuals with SCD, what is the effect of screening with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) on cardiac and pulmonary complications?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In children and adults with SCD, assess for signs and symptoms of respiratory problems (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], restrictive lung disease, or obstructive sleep apnea) by history and physical examination. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>In children and adults with SCD found to have signs or symptoms of respiratory problems by history and/or physical examination, further assessment, which includes PFTs, is recommended to determine the cause and develop a plan to address the problem. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Do not screen asymptomatic children and adults with PFTs. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reproductive Counseling</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence reviews on this topic were not performed by the methodology team. The expert panel based its recommendations on a review of the literature and consensus opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Recommendations for Women or Men with SCD</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Pregnancy in women with SCD is considered high risk, and there is an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including fetal (intrauterine) growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. </li>
        <li>Additional fetal surveillance is required during a pregnancy. </li>
        <li>There are increased risks to a woman's health during pregnancy. These risks include an increased frequency of pain crises and an increased risk of thrombosis, infections, preeclampsia, and death relative to women who do not have SCD. </li>

<p>For women who require chronic opioid therapy during pregnancy, there is an increased risk of neonatal withdrawal in their newborns.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contraception</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence reviews on this topic were not performed by the methodology team. Therefore, the expert panel based its recommendations on those developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Progestin-only contraceptives (pills, injections, and implants), levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (IUDs), and barrier methods have no restrictions or concerns for use in women with SCD. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>

<p class="Note">*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as "consensus." Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with SCD presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

<p>Due to the comprehensive scope of the guidelines, the search strategies for the systematic reviews were designed to have high sensitivity and low specificity; hence, the strategies were often derived from population and condition terms (e.g., people with sickle cell disease [SCD] who have priapism) and not restricted or combined with outcome or intervention terms. To be inclusive of the available literature in the field, searches included randomized trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Case reports and small case series were included only when outcomes involved harm (e.g., the adverse effects of hydroxyurea) or when rare complications were expected to be reported.</p>
<p>Literature searches involved multiple databases (e.g., Medline&reg; In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE&reg;, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL&reg;], TOXLINE&reg;, and Scopus) and used controlled vocabulary (prespecified) terms supplemented with keywords to define concept areas.</p>
<p>An updated search was performed to span the time from June 1, 2010 through July 11, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline-specific Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive study of several databases was conducted, and all human studies in English published from January 1970 to December 2010 that addressed each Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study Design (PICOS) question were identified. In the specific instances of antibiotic therapy and blood pressure screening, the review began from database inception through January and July 2011, respectively. In the case of screening, the review went through July 2010. Meta-analysis was only feasible in two areas: (1) efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in children and (2) hypertension (HTN) in SCD. The topics of reproductive counseling, contraception, clinical preventive health care services, and immunizations were not searched; recommendations were derived from guidelines published by professional organizations that were based on systematic reviews of broader population groups; these recommendations are labeled "Consensus&ndash;Adapted."</p>

<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Methodologists developed evidence tables to summarize individual study findings and present the quality of evidence (i.e., confidence in the estimates of effect). The tables included descriptions of study population, sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes, interventions, and outcomes. Additional methodological details are discussed in each evidence table, including the search question, search strategy, study selection process, and list of excluded studies (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Framework</strong></p>
<p>The methodology team used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to grade the quality of evidence, and, in concert with the panel, determine the strength of recommendations. The GRADE framework is accepted by more than 75 national and international organizations (see exhibit 3 in the original guideline document). It provides the advantages of: (a) separately judging the quality of supporting evidence and strength of recommendations, and (b) incorporating factors other than evidence in decisionmaking (e.g., the balance of benefits and harms; the perceived values and preferences of those with SCD; resources; and clinical and social context). GRADE emphasizes the use of patient-important outcomes (i.e., outcomes that affect the way patients feel, function, or survive) over laboratory and physiologic outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Determining Evidence Quality</strong></p>
<p>In the GRADE framework, the quality of evidence (in this case, the body of evidence) is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The quality of evidence derived from randomized trials starts as "high," and the quality of evidence derived from observational studies starts as "low." The quality of evidence can then be lowered due to methodological limitations in individual studies (risk of bias), inconsistency across studies (heterogeneity), indirectness (the extent to which the evidence fails to apply to the specific clinical question in terms of the patients, interventions, or outcomes), imprecision (typically due to a small number of events or wide confidence intervals), and the presence of publication and reporting biases. Conversely, the quality of evidence can be upgraded in certain situations such as when the treatment effect is large or a dose-response relationship is evident.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel and methodology team identified existing systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines that were relevant to the topics of this guideline, even though they were not necessarily specific to people with SCD. If the methodological quality of these resources was found to be appropriate by the methodology team, they were used. Using this external evidence was considered helpful because well-conducted systematic reviews made the process of identifying relevant studies more feasible. In addition, using existing guidelines developed by professional organizations enabled the panel to develop more comprehensive recommendations that addressed specific aspects of care in individuals with SCD. Usually, this external evidence was derived from studies in non-sickle cell patient cohorts because it was felt that they offered more precise and useful inferences than evidence derived from sickle cell patient studies. For example, comparative evidence in the area of pain management in people with SCD was sparse. In this situation, pain management guidelines from individuals with other pain-related conditions proved to be helpful.</p>
<p>The methodology team used the AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Recent well-conducted systematic reviews were identified that addressed hydroxyurea therapy in pediatric and adult patients. The expert panel and methodology team appraised these reviews and conducted additional searches to update the existing systematic review through May 2010 to find evidence for the benefits, harms, and barriers of using hydroxyurea. Regarding the management of children with SCD complications, the panel also used recent evidence that had been systematically reviewed.</p>
<p>Existing clinical practice guidelines were considered acceptable if they had prespecified clinical questions, were developed after a comprehensive literature search, had explicit and clear criteria for the inclusion of evidence, and included recommendations that were explicitly linked to the quality of supporting evidence. The expert panel and methodology team used relevant recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) "Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use," and the American Pain Society's "Guideline for the Management of Acute and Chronic Pain in Sickle-Cell Disease," and "Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Chronic Opioid Therapy in Chronic Noncancer Pain."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline-specific Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>Meta-analysis was only feasible in two areas: (1) efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in children and (2) hypertension (HTN) in SCD.</p>
<p>Detailed information on the evaluated studies as well as the observational and case studies/series referenced can be found in the evidence tables for this guideline (see the systematic reviews in the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>These guidelines were developed by an expert panel composed of health care professionals with expertise in family medicine, general internal medicine, adult and pediatric hematology, psychiatry, transfusion medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency department nursing, and evidence-based medicine. Panel members were selected by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Process and Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel first convened in the spring of 2009 to establish the vision and purpose of the panel, discuss the process and schedule for producing the guidelines, and determine the critical areas to be addressed. Prior to this meeting, the expert panel participated in a conference call to introduce the panel's work and discuss the overarching questions that should be answered by the guidelines. Before beginning the writing of the guidelines report, the expert panel divided its work into sections dealing with preventive care or health maintenance, recognition and management of acute sickle-cell disease (SCD)-related complications, recognition and management of chronic SCD-related complications, and the two most broadly assessed and available disease-modifying therapies for SCD, hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusions.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the methodology team and the supporting evidence center, the panel then developed key questions and literature search terms to identify evidence. The field of SCD has a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or large prospective cohort studies to guide clinical decisionmaking; therefore, few of the recommendations in this document are based on this highest quality evidence. For common health issues, the panel included the evidence-based recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as well as vetted recommendations of other groups. These recommendations include the SCD reproductive-related recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the immunization recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the acute and chronic pain management recommendations of the American Pain Society (APS). These recommendations are denoted as "Consensus&ndash;Adapted."</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to provide practical guidance for common problems that may lie outside of the panel's evidence reviews or available science, in many areas the published evidence was supplemented by the expertise of the panel members, who have many years of experience in managing and studying individuals with SCD. Recommendations based on the opinions of the expert panel members are labeled as "Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise." Each is clearly labeled with the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence available to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Determining the Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework rates the strength of recommendations as "strong" or "weak." However, the panel modified the GRADE system and used a third category&mdash;moderate&mdash;when they determined that patients would be better off if they followed a recommendation, despite there being some level of uncertainty about the magnitude of benefit of the intervention or the relative net benefit of alternative courses of action. The panel intends for these moderate-strength recommendations to be used to populate protocols of care and provide a guideline based on the best available evidence. The panel does not intend for weak- or moderate-strength recommendations to generate quality-of-care indicators or accountability measures or affect insurance reimbursement. Variation in care in the areas of weak- or moderate-strength recommendations may be acceptable, particularly in ways that reflect patient values and preferences. Conversely, strong recommendations represent areas in which there is confidence in the evidence supporting net benefit, and the recommendations likely apply to most individuals with sickle cell anemia. For more information, see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p></div></p>

<p class="Note">*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as "consensus." Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with sickle cell disease [SCD] presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

The guidelines were also posted to the NHLBI Web site for an extensive public review and comment period, which resulted in the submission of more than 1,300 comments from individuals and professional societies. The expert panel and NHLBI staff reviewed each comment or recommendation, many of which resulted in a revision to the guidelines. The guidelines were then reviewed by SCD experts representing three professional societies.</p></div></p>
