<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost-effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost-effective, but other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre (NCGC) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the literature search was to systematically identify all published clinical evidence relevant to the review questions. Searches were undertaken according to the parameters stipulated within the NICE Guidelines Manual 2009 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Databases were searched using medical subject headings and free-text terms. Foreign language studies were not reviewed and, where possible, searches were restricted to articles published in the English language. All searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, and were updated for the final time on October 10, 2012. No papers after this date were considered.</p>
<p>Search strategies were quality assured by cross-checking reference lists of highly relevant papers, analysing search strategies in other systematic reviews, and asking Guideline Development Group (GDG) members to highlight any additional studies. The questions, the study types applied, the databases searched and the years covered can be found in Appendix D of the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of records retrieved by the searches were sifted for relevance, with potentially significant publications obtained in full text. These were assessed against the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>The inclusion/exclusion of studies was based on the review protocols (see Appendix C of the full version of the original guideline). The GDG were consulted about any uncertainty regarding inclusion/exclusion.</p>
<p>The guideline population was defined to be people with chronic hepatitis B who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) persistently for more than 6 months. For some review questions, the review population was confined to special groups such as people who are immunocompromised, co-infected with hepatitis C or delta (D) virus or have decompensated liver disease or pregnant women.</p>
<p>Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, and observational studies (including diagnostic or prognostic studies) were included in the evidence reviews as appropriate. Laboratory studies (in vivo or in vitro) were excluded with the exception of the additional review requested by the GDG (examining whether the efficacy of tenofovir was comparable in nucleoside na&iuml;ve and lamivudine resistant populations with chronic hepatitis B infection) to support an assumption in the network meta-analysis. The reason of including laboratory (in vivo in vitro) studies for that review is due to a lack of evidence on the efficacy of tenofovir in these two populations shown by human studies (randomised trial and observational studies), although it is widely accepted in clinical practice. In addition, the GDG considered laboratory studies as a reliable source of evidence for this particular review.</p>
<p>Conference abstracts were not automatically excluded from the review but were initially assessed against the inclusion criteria and then further processed only if no other full publication was available for that review question, in which case the authors of the selected abstracts were contacted for further information. The reviews that had included abstracts were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Health care setting to initiate pre-therapeutic tests </li>
    <li>Optimal timing/frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance </li>
    <li>Patient/carer information </li>
</ul>
<p>Literature reviews, letters and editorials, foreign language publications and unpublished studies were excluded.</p>
<p>The review protocols are presented in Appendix C of the full version of the guideline. Excluded studies by review question (with their exclusion reasons) are listed in Appendix L.</p>
<p><strong>Health Economic Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Systematic searches were also undertaken to identify relevant health economic evidence within the published literature. The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database were searched using broad population terms and no date restrictions. A search was also run in MEDLINE and EMBASE using a specific economic filter with population terms. Where possible, searches were restricted to articles published in the English language. Economics search strategies are included in Appendix D of the full guideline. All searches were updated for the final time on October 10, 2012. No papers published after this date were considered.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion/Exclusion</em></p>
<p>Full economic evaluations (studies comparing costs and health consequences of alternative courses of action: cost&ndash;utility, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses) and comparative costing studies that addressed the review question in the relevant population were considered potentially applicable as economic evidence.</p>
<p>Studies that only reported cost per hospital (not per patient), or only reported average cost-effectiveness without disaggregated costs and effects, were excluded. Abstracts, posters, reviews, letters/editorials, foreign language publications and unpublished studies were excluded. Studies judged to have an applicability rating of 'not applicable' were excluded (this included studies that took the perspective of a non-OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] country).</p>
<p>Remaining studies were prioritised for inclusion based on their relative applicability to the development of this guideline and the study limitations. For example, if a high quality, directly applicable UK analysis was available other less relevant studies may not have been included. Where exclusions occurred on this basis, this is noted in the relevant section.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre (NCGC) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p>The evidence was reviewed following these steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Potentially relevant studies were identified for each review question from the relevant search results by reviewing titles and abstracts. Full papers were then obtained. </li>
    <li>Full papers were reviewed against pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to identify studies that addressed the review question in the appropriate population (review protocols are included in Appendix C of the full guideline document). </li>
    <li>Relevant studies were critically appraised using the appropriate checklists as specified in The Guidelines Manual. For diagnostic questions, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) followed the checklist developed by QUADAS II. </li>
    <li>Key information was extracted on the study's methods and patient, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) factors and results were presented in evidence tables (see Appendix E in the full guideline document). </li>
    <li>Summaries of the evidence were generated by outcome (included in the relevant chapter write-ups) and were presented in GDG meetings:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Randomised studies: meta-analysed, where appropriate and reported in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) profiles (for intervention reviews) </li>
        <li>Prognostic studies: data were presented as a range of values, usually in terms of the relative effect as reported by the authors. </li>
        <li>Diagnostic studies were presented as measures of diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value). Coupled values of sensitivity and specificity were summarized in Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) to allow visual comparison between different index tests (plotting data at different thresholds) and to investigate heterogeneity more effectively (given data were reported at the same thresholds). A meta-analysis could not be conducted because the studies reported data at various thresholds. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Twenty percent (20%) of each of the above stages of the reviewing process was quality assured by the second reviewer to eliminate any potential of reviewer bias or error.</p>
<p>Detailed data synthesis and review methods for clinical effectiveness are described in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the full guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Clinical Evidence</strong></p>
<p>After results were pooled, the overall quality of evidence for each outcome was considered. The following procedure was adopted when using GRADE:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A quality rating was assigned, based on the study design. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) start HIGH and observational studies as LOW, uncontrolled case series as LOW. </li>
    <li>The rating was then downgraded for the specified criteria: Risk of bias (study limitations), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. These criteria are detailed in the full version of the original guideline. Evidence from observational studies (that had not previously been downgraded) was upgraded if there was: a large magnitude of effect, dose-response gradient, and if all plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect. Each quality element considered to have "serious" or "very serious" risk of bias was rated at 1 or 2 points respectively. </li>
    <li>The downgraded/upgraded marks were then summed and the overall quality rating was revised. For example, all RCTs started as HIGH and the overall quality became MODERATE, LOW or VERY LOW if 1, 2 or 3 points were deducted respectively. </li>
    <li>The reasons used for downgrading were specified in the footnotes. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NICE Economic Evidence Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The NICE economic evidence profile has been used to summarise cost and cost-effectiveness estimates. The economic evidence profile shows, for each economic study, an assessment of applicability and methodological quality, with footnotes indicating the reasons for the assessment. These assessments were made by the health economist using the economic evaluation checklist from The Guidelines Manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). It also shows incremental costs, incremental outcomes (for example, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from the primary analysis, as well as information about the assessment of uncertainty in the analysis.</p>
<p>If a non-UK study was included in the profile, the results were converted into pounds sterling using the appropriate purchasing power parity.</p>
<p>Where economic studies compare multiple strategies, results are presented in the economic evidence profiles for the pair-wise comparison specified in the review question, irrespective of whether or not that comparison was 'appropriate' within the analysis being reviewed. A comparison is 'appropriate' where an intervention is compared with the next most expensive non-dominated option &ndash; a clinical strategy is said to 'dominate' the alternatives when it is both more effective and less costly. Footnotes indicate if a comparison was 'inappropriate' in the analysis.</p>
<p>For particular studies comparing multiple strategies, results are not reported in the standard economic profile but are instead presented at the end of the relevant chapter in an alternative table summarising the study as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Undertaking New Health Economic Analysis</strong></p>
<p>As well as reviewing the published economic literature for each review question, as described above, new economic analysis was undertaken by the Health Economist in priority areas. Priority areas for new health economic analysis were agreed by the GDG after formation of the review questions and consideration of the available health economic evidence.</p>
<p>Additional data for the analysis was identified as required through additional literature searches undertaken by the Health Economist, and discussion with the GDG. Model structure, inputs and assumptions were explained to and agreed by the GDG members during meetings, and they commented on subsequent revisions.</p>
<p>See Appendices H and I of the full version of the original guideline document for details of the health economic analysis/analyses undertaken for the guideline.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Clinical Guideline Centre (NCGC) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Group</strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising professional group members and consumer representatives of the main stakeholders developed this guideline.</p>
<p>The group met every 5-6 weeks during the development of the guideline.</p>
<p>Staff from the NCGC provided methodological support and guidance for the development process. The team working on the guideline included a project manager, systematic reviewers, health economists and information scientists. They undertook systematic searches of the literature, appraised the evidence, conducted meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate and drafted the guideline in collaboration with the GDG.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the guideline development process, the GDG was presented with:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence tables of the clinical and economic evidence reviewed from the literature. All evidence tables are in Appendices E and F of the full guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
    <li>Summary of clinical (GRADE tables) and economic evidence and quality (as presented in chapters 5-11 of the full version of the guideline). </li>
    <li>Forest plots and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves (See Appendix G of the full guideline). </li>
    <li>A description of the methods and results of the cost-effectiveness analysis undertaken for the guideline (See Appendix H and I of the full guideline). </li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations were drafted on the basis of the GDG's interpretation of the available evidence, taking into account the trade-off between benefits, harms and costs of different courses of action. This was either done formally in an economic model, or informally. Firstly, the net benefit over harm was considered (clinical effectiveness), using the critical outcomes. When this was done informally, the GDG took into account the clinical benefits/harms when one intervention was compared with another. The assessment of net benefit was moderated by the importance placed on the outcomes (the GDG's values and preferences), and the confidence the GDG had in the evidence (evidence quality). Secondly, it was assessed whether the net benefit justified the costs. Results of the network meta-analyses (NMA) was also taken into account in the drafting of recommendations and were incorporated in the health economic modelling for considering the most clinical and cost-effective antiviral treatment.</p>
<p>When clinical and economic evidence was of poor quality, conflicting or absent, the GDG drafted recommendations based on their expert opinion. The considerations for making consensus based recommendations included the balance between potential harms and benefits, economic or other implications compared to the benefits, current practices, recommendations made in other relevant guidelines, patient preferences and equality issues. The consensus recommendations were done through discussions in the GDG. The GDG could also consider whether the uncertainty is sufficient to justify delaying making a recommendation to await further research, taking into account the potential harm of failing to make a clear recommendation (See Appendix K of the full guideline). The wording of recommendations was agreed by the GDG and focused on the following factors:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>On the actions health professionals need to take </li>
    <li>Include what readers need to know </li>
    <li>Reflect the strength of the recommendation (for example the word "offer" was used for strong recommendations and "consider" for weak recommendations) </li>
    <li>Emphasise the involvement of the patient (and/or their carers if needed) in decisions on treatment and care </li>
    <li>Follow NICE's standard advice on recommendations about drugs, waiting times and ineffective interventions </li>
</ul>
<p>The main considerations specific to each recommendation are outlined in the 'Recommendations and Link to Evidence' sections within each chapter in the full version of the guideline.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost-effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost-effective, but other options may be similarly cost-effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Cost Analysis</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness Criteria</strong></p>
<p>In general, an intervention was considered to be cost effective if either of the following criteria applied (given that the estimate was considered plausible):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The intervention dominated other relevant strategies (that is, it was both less costly in terms of resource use and more clinically effective compared with all the other relevant alternative strategies), or </li>
    <li>The intervention cost less than &pound;20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with the next best strategy. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the Guideline Development Group (GDG) recommended an intervention that was estimated to cost more than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, or did not recommend one that was estimated to cost less than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, the reasons for this decision are discussed explicitly in the 'from evidence to recommendations' section of the relevant chapter of the full version of the guideline with reference to issues regarding the plausibility of the estimate or to the factors set out in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) report 'Social value judgements: principles for the development of NICE guidance'.</p>
<p>If a study reported the cost per life year gained but not QALYs, the cost per QALY gained was estimated by multiplying by an appropriate utility estimate to aid interpretation. The estimated cost per QALY gained is reported in the economic evidence profile with a footnote detailing the life-years gained and the utility value used. When QALYs or life years gained are not used in the analysis, results are difficult to interpret unless one strategy dominates the others with respect to every relevant health outcome and cost.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure and is prone to sampling errors. Considering the risk of complications and patient reluctance to undergo liver biopsy, non-invasive tests may be preferred by some patients. Liver biopsy may be avoided in some patients especially those who are classified as having minimal fibrosis (METAVIR &lt;F2) or those with definite cirrhosis (METAVIR F4) by the non-invasive tests. Identifying advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis can reduce the risk of further complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. </li>
    <li>There are advantages and disadvantages of pegylated interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues. Main disadvantages of nucleos(t)ide analogues are the long duration of treatment and the risk of developing resistance. </li>
    <li>Because of the likely long duration of treatment, the prevention of development of resistance is paramount. Resistance to lamivudine confers cross-resistance to emtricitabine, telbivudine and entecavir. Circulating levels of resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) may also lead to increased resistant virus transmission. </li>
    <li>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) considered that safety issues, bearing in mind the likely long duration of nucleos(t)ide therapy must be given careful consideration. Focus on renal, bone and developmental problems in adults raises the need for continued vigilance and the need for further evidence from longer term studies in children. </li>
    <li>The GDG noted that assessment of fibrosis is a sensitive area in children. Paediatricians are cautious in using drug treatments where long-term safety is not determined. The expert co-optee informed the GDG that currently nucleoside agents were used infrequently and within a very small population of children. The GDG agreed that, in the absence of proven effective therapy, children and young people should ideally be treated with anti-viral therapy only in clinical trials, except for compassionate use or clinical need. The GDG, therefore, recommended that antiviral drugs could be considered in children, but included a footnote to the recommendation, that each of the antiviral drugs did not have UK marketing authorisation for use in children and that the prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. </li>
    <li>The GDG believed that interferon side effects impact significantly on patient compliance and acceptability. </li>
    <li>Lamivudine in the third trimester of pregnancy (in addition to HBV vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin [HBIg]) was found to be beneficial in reducing the proportion of newborns with HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) seropositivity, infants HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity at 52 weeks compared to placebo (in addition to HBV vaccine and HBIg). However, this must be balanced against the potentially toxic side effects of the drug on mothers and infants. </li>
    <li>The risk of reactivation, both virological (HBV DNA) and clinical (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), is high in hepatitis B positive patients receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, especially when these regimens include corticosteroids or rituximab. Therefore, HBsAg, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) testing should be performed in people who are at high risk of HBV infection to enable for identification, prophylaxis and monitoring. </li>
    <li>False-negative and false-positive rate tests results:&nbsp; In the former case, patients missed by the test would not receive appropriate treatment and would then be at risk of developing advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, although monitoring might pick this up. In the latter case, patients with a false-positive test result would either have a biopsy or would start antiviral treatment and be monitored for effectiveness. The GDG considered it essential to avoid false-negative assignment, so the sensitivity was considered more important than specificity. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summaries of product characteristics of any drugs. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. </li>
    <li>This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented. See the General Medical Council's Good practice in prescribing medicines &ndash; guidance for doctors for further information. Where recommendations have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications ('off-label use'), these drugs are marked with a footnote in the recommendations. </li>
    <li>Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the National Health Service (NHS) Constitution for England &ndash; all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If the patient is under 16, their family or carers should also be given information and support to help the child or young person to make decisions about their treatment. Healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health's advice on consent. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow advice on consent from the Welsh Government. </li>
    <li>NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient experience in adult NHS services. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (also see the section "Patient-centred care" in the original guideline document). </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has developed tools to help organisations implement this guidance. These are available on the <a href="/web/20180712214031/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=46933&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fguidance.nice.org.uk%2fCG165" title="NICE Web site">NICE Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712214031im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>; see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key Priorities for Implementation</strong></span></p>
<p>The following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Referral</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Arrange the following tests in primary care for adults who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)/antibody (anti-HBe) status </li>
        <li>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level </li>
        <li>Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) </li>
        <li>Hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) </li>
        <li>Hepatitis delta virus antibody (anti-HDV) </li>
        <li>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody (anti-HIV) </li>
        <li>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) </li>
        <li>Additional laboratory tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), serum albumin, total bilirubin, total globulins, full blood count and prothrombin time </li>
        <li>Tests for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including hepatic ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein testing </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Include the results of the initial tests with the referral. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment Sequence in Adults With HBeAg-Positive Chronic Hepatitis B and Compensated Liver Disease</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Offer a 48-week course of peginterferon alfa-2a as first-line treatment in adults with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease<sup>1</sup>. </li>
    <li>Offer tenofovir disoproxil as second-line treatment to people who do not undergo HBeAg seroconversion or who relapse (revert to being HBeAg positive following seroconversion) after first-line treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a. </li>
    <li>Offer entecavir as an alternative second-line treatment to people who cannot tolerate tenofovir disoproxil or if it is contraindicated. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment Sequence in Adults with HBeAg-Negative Chronic Hepatitis B and Compensated Liver Disease</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Offer a 48-week course of peginterferon alfa-2a as first-line treatment in adults with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease<sup>1</sup>. </li>
    <li>Offer entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil as second-line treatment to people with detectable HBV DNA after first-line treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Women Who Are Pregnant or Breastfeeding</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Offer tenofovir disoproxil to women with HBV DNA greater than 107 IU/ml in the third trimester to reduce the risk of transmission of HBV to the baby<sup>2</sup>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prophylactic Treatment during Immunosuppressive Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In people who are HBsAg positive and have HBV DNA greater than 2000 IU/ml, offer prophylaxis with entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil<sup>3</sup>.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Start prophylaxis before beginning immunosuppressive therapy and continue for a minimum of 6 months after HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA is undetectable. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In people who are HBsAg positive and have HBV DNA less than 2000 IU/ml, offer prophylaxis:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Consider lamivudine<sup>3</sup> if immunosuppressive therapy is expected to last less than 6 months
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Monitor HBV DNA monthly in people treated with lamivudine and change to tenofovir disoproxil if HBV DNA remains detectable after 3 months </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Consider entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil<sup>3</sup> if immunosuppressive therapy is expected to last longer than 6 months </li>
        <li>Start prophylaxis before beginning immunosuppressive therapy and continue for a minimum of 6 months after stopping immunosuppressive therapy. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><sup>1</sup> Avoid use of peginterferon alfa-2a in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs risk. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception throughout therapy.</p>
