<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For women with early-stage invasive breast cancer and with known estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, which other biomarkers have demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on the need for adjuvant systemic therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician may use the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) (Oncotype DX; Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use the 21-gene RS (Oncotype DX) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the 21-gene RS (Oncotype DX) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician may use the 12-gene risk score (EndoPredict; Sividon Diagnostics, K&ouml;ln, Germany) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.5</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use the 12-gene risk score (EndoPredict; Sividon Diagnostics) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.6</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the 12-gene risk score (EndoPredict; Sividon Diagnostics) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.7 (1.1.1 in 2017)</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer, the MammaPrint (Agendia, Irvine, CA) assay may be used in those with high clinical risk per MINDACT (Microarray in Node-Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Diseases May Avoid Chemotherapy) categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a good-prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.7 (1.1.2 in 2017)</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR&ndash;positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer, the MammaPrint (Agendia) assay should not be used in those with low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, because women in the low clinical risk category had excellent outcomes and did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy even with a genomic high-risk cancer (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.7 (1.2.1 in 2017)</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR&ndash;positive, HER2-negative, node-positive breast cancer, the MammaPrint (Agendia) assay may be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at high clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to its ability to identify a good prognosis population with potentially limited chemotherapy benefit. However, such patients should be informed that a benefit of chemotherapy cannot be excluded, particularly in patients with greater than one involved lymph node (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.7 (1.2.2 in 2017)</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR&ndash;positive, HER2-negative, node-positive breast cancer, the MammaPrint (Agendia) assay should not be used in patients with one to three positive nodes and at low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. There are insufficient data on the clinical utility of MammaPrint in this specific patient population (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.8 (1.3 in 2017)</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the MammaPrint (Agendia) assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. Additional studies are required to address the role of MammaPrint in patients with this tumor subtype who are also receiving HER-2-targeted therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.9 (1.4 in 2017)</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR&ndash;negative and HER2-negative breast cancer (triple-negative), the clinician should not use the MammaPrint (Agendia) assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.10</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician may use the PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay; NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) in conjunction with other clinicopathologic variables to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.11</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-positive) breast cancer, the clinician should not use the PAM50-ROR score (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay; NanoString Technologies) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.12</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the PAM50-ROR score (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay; NanoString Technologies) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.13</em>: If a patient has triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the PAM50-ROR score (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay; NanoString Technologies) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.14</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer, the clinician may use the Breast Cancer Index (bioTheranostics, San Diego, CA) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.15</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive breast cancer, the clinician should not use the Breast Cancer Index (bioTheranostics) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.16</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the Breast Cancer Index (bioTheranostics) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.17</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-positive or node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician should not use the five-protein assay Mammostrat (GE Healthcare, Aliso Viejo, CA) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.18</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the five-protein assay Mammostrat (GE Healthcare) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.19</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-positive or node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician should not use the immunohistochemistry 4 (IHC-4) assay to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.20</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use IHC-4 to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.21</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician may use the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.22</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use the uPA and PAI-1 to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.23</em>: The clinician should not use circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.24</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-positive or node-negative) breast cancer, the clinician should not use tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.25</em>: If a patient has HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer, the clinician should not use TILs to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.26</em>: Ki-67 labeling index by IHC should not be used to guide the choice of adjuvant chemotherapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.27</em>: If a patient has ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast cancer and has had 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of recurrence, the clinician should not use multiparameter gene expression or protein assays (Oncotype DX, EndoPredict, PAM50, Breast Cancer Index, or IHC-4) to guide decisions on extended endocrine therapy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel developed its recommendations based on evidence identified through online searches of Medline and the Cochrane Library (from January 2006 through August 2015, to overlap with the search end date for the 2007 guideline update on tumor markers in breast cancer [Harris et al., 2007]), and their own clinical experience. See Data Supplement 4 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for full details on the search string. A combined PubMed search was conducted for this guideline and for a similar guideline on use of biomarkers to guide decisions on systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with articles selected for each guideline's systematic review based on the patient population studied. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Population: Women with early stage invasive breast cancer being considered for adjuvant systemic therapy, with separate sub-questions and analyses on patient groups with:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease </li>
        <li>HER2-positive disease </li>
        <li>Triple receptor negative disease (estrogen receptor-negative [ER-negative], progesterone receptor-negative [PR-negative], and HER2-negative) </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Publications in English were included if they reported rigorously conducted systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective biomarker analyses of samples from completed prospective RCTs, or prospective observational studies that directly compared outcomes of treatment decisions made on the basis of assay results with outcomes of treatment decisions made regardless of assay results. </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews; (3) published in a non-English language; (4) retrospective observational studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Addendum</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Update Process</strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updates. This approach is intended to identify new, potentially practice-changing data (i.e., signals) that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. The Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides additional information about the signals approach. </p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Fifty studies comprise the evidence base. They included three meta-analyses, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), 38 prospective-retrospective studies, three prospective comparative observational studies, and five retrospective observational studies. </p>
<p>Also see Data Supplement 5 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) Diagram showing exclusions and inclusions of publications identified for the systematic review.</p>

<p><strong>Panel Composition</strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, community oncology, statistician, and health outcome researchers, the Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting and three webinars. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel. The Expert Panel members are listed in Appendix Table A1 of the original guideline document. </p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document. </p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz&trade; software. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality, to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Addendum</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Update Process</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met via conference calls to consider the evidence for each of the 2017 recommendations on Mamma Print (Appendix Table A2, online only). The guideline was circulated in draft form to the Expert Panel for review and approval. ASCO's Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee reviewed and approved the final document. Because this was a focused update based on the signal described above, only MammaPrint was reviewed by the Panel for this update.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A biomarker-based test is judged to have clinical utility if use of the test is associated with a favorable balance of benefits to harms compared with treatment of the patient in the absence of the biomarker test result. Benefits may include improvement in survival end points such as event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), or overall survival (OS). A new biomarker test must be shown to contribute clinically useful information beyond that already provided by clinical or pathologic indicators in standard use, unless the new test can provide equivalent information at lower cost, less invasively, or with less inconvenience or risk. The magnitude of the benefit must be clinically meaningful and outweigh risks, costs, and/or inconvenience associated with use of the test. Refer to the "Clinical Utility" section in the original guideline document for additional discussion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Addendum</span></strong></p>
<p>The Use of Biomarkers Update Committee clarified that reduction in toxicity of treatment also can be considered a benefit. For example, a biomarker test that provides evidence that a patient can be treated effectively with hormonal therapy alone provides benefit to that patient by avoiding the potential serious toxicity of chemotherapy. </p>
<p>Refer to the "Clinical interpretation of literature review" sections of the original guideline document and the addendum for a discussion of the relative benefits of testing for specific biomarkers to guide therapy decisions. </p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>None of the included studies evaluated adverse outcomes of biomarker testing. In addition, no studies reported on changes in quality-of-life outcomes attributable to biomarker testing.</p>
<p>When the panel considered each of the tumor biomarker assay tests, the use context, analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility were considered. For the use context of estimating prognosis to consider whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be administered, the panel recommended use of a tumor biomarker assay if high levels of evidence suggest that it identifies a group of patients for whom the absolute benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could not exceed 2% to 3%, which is roughly equal to the risk of fatal, life-threatening, or permanently changing toxicities. For other use contexts, the panel's considerations are noted in the appropriate section of the original guideline document. </p></div></p>

Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence in the net effect of a given course of action. The use of such words as must, must not, should, and should not indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but latitude exists for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.
