<p><strong><em>Note on recommendations for laboratory monitoring for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and tuberculosis (TB) screening in patients receiving biologics or tofacitinib</em></strong>: The panel endorsed the recommendations previously published in the 2008 recommendations and in the 2012 update to be included in the 2015 recommendations (see Table 3 and Figure 6 in the original guideline document). The panel indicated that in the absence of significant new knowledge, development of an alternate recommendation was not warranted with one exception: the Voting Panel recommended that the same TB screening algorithm as described for biologics should be followed for patients receiving tofacitinib.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Early Rheumatology Rheumatoid (RA) Patients</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>The authors strongly recommend using a treat-to-target strategy rather than a non-targeted approach, regardless of disease activity level</strong>. The ideal target should be low disease activity or remission, as determined by the clinician and the patient. In some cases, another target may be chosen because risk tolerance by patients or comorbidities may mitigate the usual choices. </li>
    <li><strong>For disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-na&iuml;ve patients with early, symptomatic RA, the authors strongly recommend DMARD monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy in patients with low disease activity and </strong><em>conditionally recommend DMARD monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy in patients with moderate or high disease activity</em>. Methotrexate should be the preferred initial therapy for most patients with early RA with active disease. </li>
    <li><strong>For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD therapy (with or without glucocorticoids), the authors strongly recommend treatment with a combination of DMARDs <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> </em>a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></em> a non-TNF biologic, with or without methotrexate (MTX) in no particular order of preference, rather than continuing DMARD monotherapy alone</strong>. Biologic therapy should be used in combination with MTX over biologic monotherapy, when possible, due to superior efficacy. </li>
    <li><em>For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite any of the above DMARD or biologic therapies, the authors conditionally recommend adding low-dose glucocorticoids (defined as &le;10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent)</em>. Low-dose glucocorticoids may also be used in patients who need a bridge until realizing the benefits of DMARD therapy. The risk/benefit ratio of glucocorticoid therapy is favorable as long as the dose is low and the duration of therapy is short. </li>
    <li><em>For patients experiencing a flare of RA, the authors conditionally recommend adding short-term glucocorticoids (&lt;3 months of treatment) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible duration, to provide a favorable benefit-risk ratio for the patient</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Established RA Patients</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>The authors strongly recommend using a treat-to-target strategy rather than a non-targeted approach, regardless of disease activity level</strong>. The ideal target should be low disease activity or remission, as determined by the clinician and the patient. In some cases, however, another target may be chosen because tolerance by patients or comorbidities may mitigate the usual choices. </li>
    <li><strong>For DMARD-na&iuml;ve patients with low disease activity, the authors strongly recommend using DMARD monotherapy over a TNFi</strong>. <em>For DMARD-na&iuml;ve patients with moderate or high disease activity, the authors conditionally recommend DMARD monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy and DMARD monotherapy over tofacitinib</em>. In general, MTX should be the preferred initial therapy for most patients with established RA with active disease. </li>
    <li><strong>For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD monotherapy including methotrexate, the authors strongly recommend using combination DMARDs <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></em> adding a TNFi <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></em> a non-TNF biologic <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span></em> tofacitinib (all choices with or without methotrexate) in no particular order of preference, rather than continuing DMARD monotherapy alone</strong>. Biologic therapy should be used in combination with MTX over biologic monotherapy, when possible, due to its superior efficacy. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For all scenarios for established RA below, treatment may be with or without MTX</span><strong>.</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>For moderate or high disease activity despite TNFi therapy in patients currently not on a DMARD, the authors strongly recommend that one or two DMARDs be added to TNFi therapy rather than continuing TNFi therapy alone</strong>. </li>
    <li><em>If disease activity is moderate or high despite single TNFi biologic therapy, the authors conditionally recommend using a non-TNF biologic</em>. </li>
    <li><em>If disease activity is moderate or high despite non-TNF biologic therapy, the authors conditionally recommend using another non-TNF biologic. However, if a patient has failed multiple non-TNF biologics and they are TNFi-na&iuml;ve with moderate or high disease activity, the authors conditionally recommend treatment with a TNFi</em>. </li>
    <li><em>For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite prior treatment with at least one TNFi and at least one non-TNF-biologic (sequentially, not combined), the authors conditionally recommend first treating with another non-TNF biologic. However, when a non-TNF biologic is not an option</em> (e.g., patient declines non-TNF biologic therapy due to inefficacy or side effects<em>), the authors conditionally recommend treatment with tofacitinib</em>. </li>
    <li><em>If disease activity is moderate or high despite the use of multiple (2+) TNFi therapies (in sequence, not concurrently), the authors conditionally recommend non-TNF biologic therapy and then conditionally treating with tofacitinib</em> when a non-TNF biologic is not an option. </li>
    <li><em>If disease activity is moderate or high despite any of the above DMARD or biologic therapies, the authors conditionally recommend adding low-dose glucocorticoids</em>. </li>
    <li><em>If patients with established RA experience an RA flare while on DMARD, TNFi, or non- TNF biologic therapy, the authors conditionally recommend adding short-term glucocorticoids (&lt;3 months of treatment) at the lowest possible dose and for shortest possible duration to provide the best benefit-risk ratio for the patient</em>. </li>
    <li><strong>In patients with established RA and low disease activity but not remission, the authors strongly recommend continuing DMARD therapy, TNFi, non-TNF biologic or tofacitinib rather than discontinuing respective medication</strong>. </li>
    <li><em>In patients with established RA currently in remission, the authors conditionally recommend tapering DMARD therapy, TNFi, non-TNF biologic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> tofacitinib</em>. </li>
    <li><strong>The authors strongly recommend <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not discontinuing</span> all therapies in patients with established RA in disease remission</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for RA Patients with High-Risk Comorbidities</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV CHF, the authors conditionally recommend using combination DMARD therapy, a non-TNF biologic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> tofacitinib rather than a TNFi</em>. </li>
    <li><em>If patients in this population are treated with a TNFi and their CHF worsens while on the TNFi, the authors conditionally recommend switching to combination DMARD therapy, a non-TNF biologic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> tofacitinib rather than a different TNFi</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hepatitis B</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and evidence of active hepatitis B infection (hepatitis surface antigen positive &gt;6 months), who are receiving or have received effective antiviral treatment, the authors strongly recommend treating them the same as patients without this condition</strong>. </li>
    <li>For a patient with natural immunity from prior exposure to hepatitis B (i.e., HB core antibody and hepatitis B surface [HBS] antibody positive and normal liver function tests), the authors recommend the same therapies as those without such findings as long as the patient's viral load is monitored. </li>
    <li>For patients with chronic hepatitis B who are untreated, referral for antiviral therapy is appropriate prior to immunosuppressive therapy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hepatitis C</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and evidence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, who are receiving or have received effective antiviral treatment, the authors conditionally recommend treating them the same as the patients without this condition</em>. </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that rheumatologists work with gastroenterologists and/or hepatologists who would monitor patients and reassess the appropriateness of antiviral therapy. This is important considering the recent availability of highly effective therapy for HCV, which may lead to a greater number of HCV patients being treated successfully. </li>
    <li><em>If the same patient is not requiring or receiving antiviral treatment for their hepatitis C, the authors conditionally recommend using DMARD therapy rather than TNFi</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Malignancy</strong></p>
<p><em>Previous Melanoma and Non-melanoma Skin Cancer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>In patients with established RA and moderate or high disease activity and a history of previously treated or untreated skin cancer (melanoma or non-melanoma), the authors conditionally recommend the use of DMARD therapy over biologics or tofacitinib</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Previous Lymphoproliferative Disorders</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and a history of a previously treated lymphoproliferative disorder, the authors strongly recommend using rituximab rather than a TNFi</strong> and <em>conditionally recommend using combination DMARD therapy, abatacept or tocilizumab rather than TNFi</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Previous Solid Organ Cancer</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and previously treated solid organ cancer, the authors conditionally recommend that they be treated for RA just as one would treat an RA patient without a history of solid organ cancer</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Serious Infections</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and previous serious infection(s), the authors conditionally recommend using combination DMARD therapy or abatacept rather than TNFi</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for the Use of Vaccines in RA Patients on DMARD and/or Biologic Therapy</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>In early or established RA patients aged 50 and over, the authors conditionally recommend giving the herpes zoster vaccine before the patient receives biologic therapy or tofacitinib for their RA</em>. </li>
    <li><em>In early or established RA patients who are currently receiving biologics, the authors conditionally recommend that live attenuated vaccines such as the herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be given </em>. </li>
    <li><strong>In patients with early or established RA who are currently receiving biologics, the authors strongly recommend using appropriately indicated killed/inactivated vaccines</strong>. </li>

<p><strong>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group Grades of Evidence </strong></p>
<p><strong>High Quality</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Quality</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low Quality</strong>: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Very Low Quality</strong>: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of the Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A strong recommendation (in bold face above) means that the panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to most patients, and only a small proportion would not want to follow the recommendation. </li>
    <li>A conditional recommendation (in italics above) means that the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but some may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a <strong>shared decision-making approach</strong>. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors performed systematic searches of the published literature to identify relevant evidence for the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes) questions. Study designs in the literature review included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies (including case series). The authors searched OVID Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; and Health Technology Assessments) (see Supplementary Appendix 2 of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The searches were performed using database-specific subject headings and keywords related to the following domains of interest: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), traditional/conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologics (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, or infliximab), non-TNF biologics (abatacept, rituximab, or tocilizumab), tofacitinib, glucocorticoids, and adverse events. Searches were limited to adults ages &ge;18 years and to English language publications. Duplicate references were removed. The authors excluded narrative reviews, editorials, scientific conference abstracts, and case reports.</p>
<p>The literature related to treatment modalities covered by past American College of Rheumatology (ACR) RA guidelines (i.e., traditional/conventional DMARDs, TNFi and non-TNF biologics) and tofacitinib was searched to include articles published from January 1, 2009 through March 3, 2014. For other treatment modalities not covered by past ACR RA guidelines (i.e., glucocorticoids), the authors searched the databases from inception until March 3, 2014. Initial literature searches were updated on September 17, 2014. All searches were developed by a medical librarian in collaboration with the Literature Review Team and were peer reviewed by a second medical librarian. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature search results underwent primary screening in DistillerSR software (Evidence Partners). During primary literature screening, 2 reviewers (various pairs, made from a pool of reviewers including authors, as well as the medical librarian) independently reviewed the title and abstract of each article for potential eligibility. A third reviewer resolved conflicts regarding inclusion versus exclusion. Articles judged as potentially eligible were tagged for electronic matching to specific PICO questions, and subsequently underwent full-text article screening. Each full text was screened by 2 reviewers and independently tagged with PICO-matching criteria. A secondary hand sorting of all randomized studies was conducted to ensure successful matching of relevant evidence to PICO questions (for details on the study selection see Supplementary Appendix 3 of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors extracted study data for each PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes) question into RevMan software. When determining which data to include, they followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology that gives preference to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) over observational studies as the highest-quality source of evidence. Whenever data from both randomized and observational trials were available, and the RCT was of high quality, the authors extracted RCT data only. A RevMan file was created for each PICO question, and data were pooled and analyzed using this software. Continuous outcome variables were analyzed using the inverse variance method in a random effects model. Continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals; standardized mean differences (similar in concept to effect sizes) were used when the outcome was measured with different scales. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using the Mantel-Haenszel method in a random effects model. These variables were reported as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment and Evidence Report Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors exported RevMan analyses into GRADEpro software to formulate a GRADE summary of findings table for each PICO question. The quality of evidence, such as the confidence in the effect estimates for each outcome, was evaluated based on GRADE quality assessment criteria. Two independent reviewers performed this GRADE quality assessment in duplicate and discordance was resolved by consensus. This included the risk of bias in included trials, the likelihood of publication bias, inconsistency between trial results, indirectness of the evidence (e.g., differences between populations, interventions, or outcomes of interest in the group to whom the recommendation applies versus those who were included in the studies referenced), and imprecision (wide confidence intervals, usually due to a small number of patients or events, or those situations where clinical decision-making would differ at the extremes of the confidence interval).</p>
<p>The GRADE method distinguishes 4 levels of quality of evidence based on the degree of confidence that the pooled effect estimate lies close to the true effect. Thus, the quality of evidence for each outcome could be rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The overall evidence quality grade was the lowest quality rating among the individual outcomes deemed critical for the comparison between interventions. In the absence of any data, the level of evidence was rated as very low, because it was based on clinical experience only.</p>
<p>The authors compiled the resulting summary of findings tables in an evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 1 in the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) that was accompanied by a qualitative summary of the evidence for each PICO question. The Content Panel reviewed the drafted evidence report and revised the report to address evidence gaps prior to presentation to the Voting Panel. The authors referred to other society/organization guidelines for topics that do not exclusively relate to rheumatologic care, such as liver disease (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD]) and TB screening and immunization (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]).</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overall Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline was developed following the recently revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline development process (<a href="/web/20180712204227/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50736&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rheumatology.org%2fPractice-Quality%2fClinical-Support%2fClinical-Practice-Guidelines" title="ACR Web site">http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712204227im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). This process includes the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (available at <a href="/web/20180712204227/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50736&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gradeworkinggroup.org" title="GRADE Web site">www.gradeworkinggroup.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712204227im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Teams Involved</span></strong></p>
<p>A Core Leadership Team supervised the project and was responsible for defining the project scope, drafting the clinical questions to be addressed by the guideline, coordinating with the Literature Review Team's efforts, and drafting the manuscript based on voting by a panel (described below). The Core Leadership Team was led by a chair who possessed both content and methodologic expertise. The Core Leadership Team also included a methodologist, who advised on the process and provided input on the GRADE summary of findings tables, and experts in guideline development. A Literature Review Team conducted the literature review, graded the quality of evidence, developed the summary of findings tables, and produced an evidence report. A Content Panel, composed of 4 content experts reviewed and provided feedback on the clinical questions and the evidence report, and provided consultation throughout the project. Finally, a Voting Panel helped determine which clinical questions would be asked and which outcomes were critical, and they voted on the final recommendations after reviewing the evidence provided by the Literature Review Team. The Voting Panel included rheumatologists with expertise and clinical experience in treating rheumatoid arthritis, as well as 2 patient representatives. Training was conducted with all members of the guideline development group to prepare them for their roles, including specific sessions on the ACR guideline process and GRADE methodology.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Establishing Key Principles and PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) Development</span></strong></p>
<p>Key principles and provisos, key terms, descriptions, and drug categories used in the guideline development process are shown in Table 1 of the original guideline document. These key principles were first reviewed by the Content Panel and the Core Leadership Team. The key principles were then provided to the Voting Panel when they reviewed the drafted evidence report, and also when they discussed and voted on each recommendation. The Core Leadership Team collaborated with the Content Panel to develop the initial set of PICO-formatted clinical questions for the guideline. The authors considered clinically relevant interventions and comparators after extensive discussion with the Content Panel and the Core Leadership Team, balancing comprehensiveness with feasibility. These PICO questions were posted for 30 days on the ACR Web site for public comment, and revised accordingly. The final set of PICO questions addressed 6 major topics.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moving from Evidence to Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Each recommendation was made based on a consideration of the balance of relative benefits and harms of the treatment options under consideration, the quality of the evidence (i.e., confidence in the effect estimates), and patients' values and preferences, as per GRADE methodology. A recommendation could be either in favor of or against the proposed intervention and either strong or conditional. According to GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention far outweigh the harms (or vice versa) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). A conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty over the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, or when patient preferences or costs are expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations refer to decisions where incorporation of patient preferences is an essential element of decision making. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Building</span></strong></p>
<p>The Voting Panel received the evidence report for review before it met to discuss and decide on the final recommendations. For each PICO question, the Voting Panel heard an oral summary of the evidence and provided votes on the direction and strength of the related recommendation during a face-to-face meeting held on October 5&ndash;6, 2014, and subsequent conference calls and e-mails. The voting process was anonymous and conducted using Poll Everywhere software (available at <a href="/web/20180712204227/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50736&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.polleverywhere.com" title="Poll Everywhere Web site">www.polleverywhere.com</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712204227im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). The authors used the 70% consensus threshold, which has been used previously in other similar processes and in previous ACR guidelines. If 70% consensus was not achieved during an initial vote, the panel members held additional discussions before voting again. In some instances (specifically, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD] monotherapy failure in early and established rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and previously treated/untreated solid organ cancer), the Voting Panel decided, based on its review of the evidence and its round 1 votes, to combine certain treatment options. They then voted on a new recommendation statement that covered a group of treatment options instead of considering each question separately. In addition, the Voting Panel dropped a number of PICO questions because the clinical scenario was uncommon, irrelevant, or redundant (see Supplementary Appendix 4 of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>The GRADE methodology contributed a great deal of transparency to the voting process. For example, all of the evidence tables contained detailed descriptions of the criteria upon which the evidence quality was rated (such as estimates of risk of bias or indirectness). As allowed for in GRADE, in some instances, the Voting Panel chose to provide a recommendation in disagreement with the expected strength based on the overall evidence quality (i.e., a strong recommendation despite a low quality rating of evidence). In such cases, a written explanation was provided describing the reasons behind this decision.</p></div></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A strong recommendation means that the panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to most patients, and only a small proportion would not want to follow the recommendation. </li>
    <li>A conditional recommendation means that the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but some may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclosures and Management of Conflicts of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) policy, everyone who was intellectually involved in the project (i.e., considered for guideline authorship) disclosed all relationships in writing at the beginning, middle, and end of the project. Disclosures were compared against a previously drafted list of "affected companies" (i.e., companies or organizations that were considered reasonably likely to be positively or negatively affected by care delivered in accordance with the guideline) to determine which relationships were considered conflicts of interest for purposes of this project. Individuals whose primary employment (&gt;51% of work time/effort) was with a company that manufactured or sold therapeutics or diagnostics were not eligible to participate.</p>
<p>The project Principal Investigator (JAS) and Literature Review Team Leader (TM) had no relevant conflicts of interest for the full 12 months before this project began, and a majority (&gt;51%) of all guideline development team members, including the Principal Investigator and Literature Review Team Leader, had no relevant conflicts of interest for the duration of the project. A participant who had any relationship with an affected company was counted as conflicted (i.e., toward the allowed threshold) regardless of the type or subject of the relationship. Intellectual conflicts, such as a prior publication or presentation on an rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapeutic, were recognized as important and were required to be disclosed, but because they were ubiquitous, participants with intellectual conflicts were not counted as conflicted (i.e., toward the allowed threshold) based on their intellectual conflict alone.</p>
<p>Participant disclosures were included in the project plan that was posted online for public comment. In addition, disclosures of all participants were shared with each project participant in writing. At the face-to-face Voting Panel meeting, verbal disclosures were provided before any content discussion. Updated participant disclosures, as well as ACR committee reviewer disclosures, are available <a href="/web/20180712204227/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50736&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rheumatology.org%2fPractice-Quality%2fClinical-Support%2fClinical-Practice-Guidelines%2fRheumatoid-Arthritis" title="ACR Web site">online</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712204227im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>.</p>
