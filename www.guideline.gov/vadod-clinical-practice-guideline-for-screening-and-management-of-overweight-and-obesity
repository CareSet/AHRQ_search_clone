<p>Grade of <strong>EO</strong> was added for "Expert Opinion".</p>
<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p>The Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) Champions were tasked with identifying key evidence questions to guide the systematic review of the literature on overweight and obesity. These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin Group's evidence review team, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations, including the benefits and harms of various pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies on weight loss and other comorbidities. The key questions follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology.</p>
<p>The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Table A-2 contains the final set of key questions used to guide the systematic review for this CPG. Table A-3 provides a detailed chart which outlines some of the decisions that the Champions made in prioritizing the key questions (see Appendix A in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conducting the Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A number of the key questions were also addressed by the AHRQ systematic evidence review entitled <em>Screening for and Management of Obesity and Overweight in Adults</em> which reviewed literature published through September 9, 2010. For key questions that overlapped with the AHRQ review, the evidence review team focused on new relevant literature published after this date. For those that were not addressed by the AHRQ report, the literature was reviewed dating back to March 2005, prior to which evidence was reviewed by the 2006 CPG Work Group. The date parameters used for each key question are shown in Table A-2 in the original guideline document. The systematic review conducted for this CPG examined literature that was published up to February 1, 2013.</p>
<p>Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were imposed on this systematic review and are described in Table A-4 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Detailed search strategies were developed for each key question and used to conduct searches in multiple biomedical bibliographic and other databases, including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCTR), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (COCH). The search strategy was based on a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terminology and text key words, and can be found in Table A-5 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The literature search identified over 4,800 titles and abstracts, which were screened and assessed by members of the evidence review team for relevance to the key questions. Over 4,400 abstracts were excluded during this first step, and the remaining 441 full text articles were reviewed. Of these, 369 studies were excluded for one of the five reasons described below and a final set of 72 studies were included in this systematic review. Additionally, since the completion of the evidence synthesis, the Champions reviewed several papers published in peer-reviewed journals. This included reviews, CPGs, editorials, and primary research articles. These were intended to be additive to the information already reviewed and were used to augment rather than create recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for Exclusion</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Study is not relevant. </li>
    <li>Search date parameters do not apply. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The evidence review team assessed the quality of the individual studies for each key question, using the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) methodology for grading the evidence. The USPSTF has developed a rigorous standard for assessing the quality of the evidence, which is utilized by other guideline development groups, such as Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Lewin adhered to this methodology in order to help determine the validity, reliability, and generalizability of the evidence. These elements were factored into the development of clinical recommendations for this clinical practice guideline (CPG).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the USPSTF updated its definition of grade C recommendations, effective July 2012. As such, the evidence grades presented in the 2006 evidence review may be different from the evidence grades presented in the 2013 review, based on the revised definitions. The CPG Work Group for the 2014 CPG critically assessed and graded each recommendation using the updated, 2013 USPSTF approach.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Lewin evidence review team modified the USPSTF grading framework so as to provide for a grade of EO for "Expert Opinion." This change is a direct reflection of the need to develop a CPG that can be used in real practice for Veterans and Service members where evidence for or against a particular intervention is lacking. The analogous USPSTF grade of an I for "Insufficient evidence" may not provide enough guidance for supporting clinical decisions in real-world practice settings, especially for clinical questions that arise frequently in practice.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>The Champions and a smaller subset of the Work Group, known as the editorial team, developed a comprehensive evidence table for this CPG, shown in Appendix C of the original guideline document, which provides detailed information on each recommendation, the grade of each recommendation, and the literature supporting each recommendation, including the certainty of evidence and magnitude of net benefit. If a recommendation was also included in the 2006 version of this CPG, the assigned grades from both 2006 and 2014 are specified. If a recommendation is new and was not addressed in the 2006 version, a N/A is marked in the 2006 grade column.</p>
<p>In some cases, a recommendation was assigned a grade of "I" for insufficient evidence. In such cases, the quality of the evidence base or the certainty of the evidence is deemed low, either due to a lack of evidence to address the question or because there is conflicting evidence as to the balance of benefits and harms.</p>
<p>In other cases, a recommendation was assigned a grade of "EO" for expert opinion. A recommendation may have an "EO" when the certainty of the evidence is low or insufficient, but, based on expert opinion, the potential magnitude of the net benefit (benefits minus harms) might be substantial enough for providers to consider offering the recommendation. In these cases, the panel used position statements or consensus building comments from major organizations, where available, to craft and support the recommendation.</p>
<p>An evidence synthesis was not performed for the direct effects of diet and physical activity on weight loss. This is because the authors/editors felt that the principle of creating an energy deficit applies to all forms of dietary and physical activity interventions and therefore new research in this area would not likely substantially change recommendations regarding their effects on weight loss.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The methodology used in developing the 2014 clinical practice guideline (CPG) follows the "Guideline for Guidelines," an internal document of the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the submission of an updated obesity CPG.</p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Specifically, the Champions for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management and treatment of overweight and obesity. In addition, the Champions assisted in:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Conducting the evidence review, including providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria </li>
    <li>Assessing the level and quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes. </li>
</ol>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Medical Command of the DoD, identified two clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 CPG.</p>
<p>The Lewin Group (Lewin), contracted by VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review, held the first conference call in November 2012, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leaders from the VA and DoD evidence-based guideline development program, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review about the management and treatment of overweight and obesity. The team also identified a list, from which the Work Group members were recruited, of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the treatment and management of overweight and obesity. The specialties and areas included were Clinical Dietetics, Family Medicine, Healthcare Systems Management and Policy, Internal Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy Benefit Management, Physical Therapy, Psychiatry, Psychology and Surgery.</p>
<p>The evidence review and synthesis portion of the guideline development process for the 2014 CPG consisted of the following steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Formulating evidence questions (key questions) </li>
    <li>Conducting the systematic review </li>
    <li>Convening a two and a half day face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the screening and management of overweight and obesity to the VA/DoD EBPWG </li>
</ul>
<p>Appendix A in the original guideline document provides a detailed description of each of these tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Reconciling 2006 Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The 2006 CPG recommendations and topics that were not subject to the 2013 evidence review were directly carried over into the 2014 CPG, without revisions to the statements or their associated grade (strength of recommendation). These "carryover" recommendations are identified in the evidence table by an arrow pointed from the 2006 grade column to the 2014 grade column. Recommendations from the 2006 CPG were only carried over into the 2014 CPG if the core intent of the original recommendation remained the same and without any substantial revisions to the wording of the recommendation. The authors of this CPG also note that in some cases, there exists additional evidence since 2006 supporting those recommendations and grades that were carried over, which simply strengthens the evidence base. This information is noted in the evidence tables under "Additional Supporting Literature." Any topic not addressed by the 2013 evidence review, which the authors felt warranted a change or addition to the 2006 recommendation addressing that topic, was noted as part of the discussion section and included the relevant new information (although not systematically reviewed).</p>
<p><strong>Convening the Face-to-Face Meeting</strong></p>
<p>In consultation with the Contracting Officer Representative, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a two and a half day face-to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on April 15-17, 2013. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2006 CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review of the key questions in order to facilitate and inform the process.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to retain, revise, or reject each recommendation from the 2006 CPG. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations, not presented in the 2006 CPG, based on the 2013 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into four smaller subgroups at this meeting.</p>
<p>Following the drafting of clinical practice recommendations, the Work Group assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence, or the certainty of the evidence to support the recommendation, and the magnitude of the net benefit of the intervention(s). Each recommendation received a grade of A (offer the service), B (offer the service), C (consider this service for some patients), D (discourage this service), I (if offered, understand that there is a level of uncertainty of evidence) or EO (consider offering this service based purely on expert opinion) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The grade of the recommendation is based on a framework that combines the two dimensions, as shown in the table below. As described above, the grade depends on both net benefit and certainty. For example, in the USPSTF grading scheme, a grade of A is assigned to a recommendation that is based on a high certainty of a substantial net benefit. Three combinations of certainty and net benefit can yield a grade of B. Note that, in the USPSTF framework, any recommendation associated with low certainty of net benefit results in a recommendation of I, regardless of the magnitude of net benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Grade of EO for Expert Opinion</strong>: During the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members used a variation of the USPSTF grading framework to provide for a grade of EO for "Expert Opinion." Given that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have to be used in real practice for Veterans and Service members, a grade of I for insufficient evidence may not provide enough guidance for supporting clinical decisions in practice. In particular, the Work Group members considered certain instances in which evidence suggests a substantial or moderate net benefit, but the certainty/strength of that evidence is low. In those instances, rather than concluding that the evidence is insufficient to support a clinical decision, the Work Group may rely on considered EO to set forth a recommendation. A grade EO does not imply that the evidence is strong (it is still low). It does suggest that the magnitude of net benefit (substantial or moderate) is of sufficient clinical importance to make a recommendation, even if it is based on low certainty (weak evidence). See Figure B-1 in the original guideline document for a framework that incorporates Expert Opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Drafting and Submitting the Final CPG</strong></p>
<p>Following the face-to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments for the update of specific sections of the 2006 CPG that would form the narrative text for the 2014 CPG. During this time, the Champions also revised the 2006 algorithms and identified the content for the guideline summary and pocket card, as part of the provider toolkits that will be developed by the Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) following the publication of the 2014 CPG. The algorithms will be included as part of this CPG so as to provide a clear description of the flow of patient care. A final two-and-a-half day face-to-face meeting of the editorial team was held from November 20-22, 2013. The final 2014 CPG was submitted to the EBPWG on March 31, 2014.</p></div></p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Any form of very-low-calorie diet requires close follow-up and should only be used when high levels of monitoring by trained medical personnel are available. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects, precautions, and drug interactions of anti-obesity agents are described in Appendix J of the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>Bariatric surgery may be associated with stricture of gastrojejunostomy, gastrointestinal bleeding, marginal ulcer, bowel obstruction, deep venous thrombosis and anastomotic leak, obstructions about the distal intestinal anastomosis (with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), and complications of the LapBand. There is also risk of mortality. See Appendix K in the original guideline document for details. </li>

    <li>The use of weight loss drugs (orlistat, phentermine and topiramate extended-release, lorcaserin) during pregnancy is contraindicated. </li>
    <li>Phentermine is contraindicated during or within 14 days following administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (see Appendix J in the original guideline document for more information on specific drug contraindications). </li>
    <li>Bupropion has a black box warning for suicidality and is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, bulimia, or anorexia. </li>
    <li>While evidence to support absolute contraindications for bariatric surgery is lacking, expert consensus states that women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy in the next 18-24 months should not be considered candidates for bariatric surgery. Other relative contraindications to bariatric surgery that are supported only by expert consensus include conditions that compromise anesthesia or wound healing, lack of patient's ability to follow pre- and postoperative instructions, general high risk surgical conditions, and reduced life expectancy for reasons unrelated to obesity. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Qualifying Statements</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines are based upon the best information available at the time of publication. They are designed to provide information and assist decision-making. They are not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. </li>
    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. </li>
    <li>Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. </li>
    <li>These guidelines are not intended to represent TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits may be found at <a href="/web/20180712211208/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48461&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tricare.mil%2f" tot;e="Tricare Web site">www.tricare.mil</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712211208im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> or by contacting your regional TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor. </li>
    <li><strong>Limitations</strong>. It is important to note that due to resource limitations, the Work Group could not formally update all aspects of the 2006 CPG. The key questions chosen for this CPG are those of highest priority that would be supported by a comprehensive evidence review. For instance, though vitally important, an evidence synthesis was not performed for the direct effects of diet and physical activity on weight loss. This is because the authors/editors felt that the principle of creating an energy deficit applies to all forms of dietary and physical activity interventions and therefore new research in this area would not likely substantially change recommendations regarding their effects on weight loss.
    <p>Additionally, the systematic review conducted for this CPG examined literature that was published up to February 1, 2013. The Work Group recognizes that several new studies have been published since that time. Consequently, the group reviewed and incorporated new evidence in developing and refining the recommendations, as long as the studies met all <em>a priori</em> inclusion criteria for the systematic review.</p>
