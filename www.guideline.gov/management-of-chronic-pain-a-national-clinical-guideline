<p><strong>A</strong> - Pregabalin (titrated up to at least 300 mg daily) is recommended for the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Flexible dosing may improve tolerability. Failure to respond after an appropriate dose for several weeks should result in trial of a different compound.</p>
<p><em>Carbamazepine</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Carbamazepine should be considered for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain. Potential risks of adverse events should be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Antidepressants</strong></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> - In patients with neuropathic pain who do not respond to gabapentinoid (gabapentin/pregabalin) alone, and who are unable to tolerate other combinations, consideration should be given to the addition of an opioid such as morphine or oxycodone. The risks and benefits of opioid use need to be considered.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Psychologically Based Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Multidisciplinary Pain Management Programmes</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Referral to a pain management programme should be considered for patients with chronic pain.</p>
<p><strong>Unidisciplinary Education</strong></p>
<p><em>Brief Education</em></p>

A systematic review of the literature was carried out using an explicit search strategy devised by a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist. Databases searched include MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. The year range covered was 2007 to 2012. Internet searches were carried out on various websites including the US National Guideline Clearinghouse. The main searches were supplemented by material identified by individual members of the development group. Each of the selected papers was evaluated by two members of the group using standard SIGN methodological checklists before conclusions were considered as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search for Patient Issues</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the guideline development process, a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist conducted a literature search for qualitative and quantitative studies that addressed patient issues of relevance to management of patients with chronic pain. Databases searched include MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and the results were summarised and presented to the guideline development group.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Once papers have been selected as potential sources of evidence, the methodology used in each study is assessed to ensure its validity. The result of this assessment will affect the level of evidence allocated to the paper, which will in turn influence the grade of recommendation that it supports.</p>
<p>The methodological assessment is based on a number of key questions that focus on those aspects of the study design that research has shown to have a significant influence on the validity of the results reported and conclusions drawn. These key questions differ between study types, and a range of checklists is used to bring a degree of consistency to the assessment process. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has based its assessments on the MERGE (Method for Evaluating Research and Guideline Evidence) checklists developed by the New South Wales Department of Health, which have been subjected to wide consultation and evaluation. These checklists were subjected to detailed evaluation and adaptation to meet SIGN's requirements for a balance between methodological rigour and practicality of use.</p>
<p>The assessment process inevitably involves a degree of subjective judgement. The extent to which a study meets a particular criterion - e.g., an acceptable level of loss to follow up - and, more importantly, the likely impact of this on the reported results from the study will depend on the clinical context. To minimise any potential bias resulting from this, each study must be evaluated independently by at least two group members. Any differences in assessment should then be discussed by the full group. Where differences cannot be resolved, an independent reviewer or an experienced member of SIGN Executive staff will arbitrate to reach an agreed quality assessment</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables are compiled by SIGN executive staff based on the quality assessments of individual studies provided by guideline development group members. The tables summarise all the validated studies identified from the systematic literature review relating to each key question. They are presented in a standard format to make it easier to compare results across studies, and will present separately the evidence for each outcome measure used in the published studies. These evidence tables form an essential part of the guideline development record and ensure that the basis of the guideline development group's recommendations is transparent.</p>

                    <p>Expert Consensus</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Synthesising the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Guideline recommendations are graded to differentiate between those based on strong evidence and those based on weak evidence. This judgement is made on the basis of an (objective) assessment of the design and quality of each study and a (perhaps more subjective) judgement on the consistency, clinical relevance and external validity of the whole body of evidence. The aim is to produce a recommendation that is evidence-based, but which is relevant to the way in which health care is delivered in Scotland and is therefore implementable.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the grading does not relate to the importance of the recommendation, but to the strength of the supporting evidence and, in particular, to the predictive power of the study designs from which that data was obtained. Thus, the grading assigned to a recommendation indicates to users the likelihood that, if that recommendation is implemented, the predicted outcome will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Considered Judgement</strong></p>
<p>It is rare for the evidence to show clearly and unambiguously what course of action should be recommended for any given question. Consequently, it is not always clear to those who were not involved in the decision making process how guideline developers were able to arrive at their recommendations, given the evidence they had to base them on. In order to address this problem, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has introduced the concept of considered judgement.</p>
<p>Under the heading of considered judgement, guideline development groups summarise their view of the total body of evidence covered by each evidence table.</p>
<p>Each guideline group considers the following factors:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quantity, quality, and consistency of evidence </li>
    <li>External validity (generalisability) of studies </li>
    <li>Directness of application to the target population for the guideline </li>
    <li>Any evidence of potential harms associated with implementation of a recommendation </li>
    <li>Clinical impact (i.e., the extent of the impact on the target patient population, and the resources needed to treat them in accordance with the recommendation) </li>
    <li>Whether, and to what extent, any equality groups may be particularly advantaged or disadvantaged by the recommendations made </li>
    <li>Implementability (i.e., how practical it would be for the National Health Service [NHS] Scotland to implement the recommendation.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then the group is asked to summarise its view on all of these issues, both the quality of the evidence and its potential impact, before making a graded recommendation. This summary should be succinct, and taken together with its views of the level of evidence represent the first draft of the text that will appear in the guideline immediately before a graded recommendation.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The national open meeting is the main consultative phase of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline development.</p>
<p><strong>Peer Review</strong></p>
<p>All SIGN guidelines are reviewed in draft form by independent expert referees, who are asked to comment primarily on the comprehensiveness and accuracy of interpretation of the evidence base supporting the recommendations in the guideline. A number of general practitioners (GPs) and other primary care practitioners also provide comments on the guideline from the primary care perspective, concentrating particularly on the clarity of the recommendations and their assessment of the usefulness of the guideline as a working tool for the primary care team. The draft is also sent to at least two lay reviewers in order to obtain comments from the patient's perspective.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all reviewers are invited to comment as individuals, not as representatives of any particular organisation or group. Corporate interests, whether commercial, professional, or societal have an opportunity to make representations at the national meeting stage where they can send representatives to the meeting or provide comment on the draft produced for that meeting. Peer reviewers are asked to complete a declaration of interests form.</p>
<p>The comments received from peer reviewers and others are carefully tabulated and discussed with the Chair and with the guideline development group. Each point must be addressed and any changes to the guideline as a result noted or, if no change is made, the reasons for this recorded.</p>
<p>As a final quality control check prior to publication, the guideline and the summary of peer reviewers' comments are reviewed by the SIGN Editorial Group for that guideline to ensure that each point has been addressed adequately and that any risk of bias in the guideline development process as a whole has been minimised. Each member of the guideline development group is then asked formally to approve the final guideline for publication.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Qualifying Statements</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. Adherence to guideline recommendations will not ensure a successful outcome in every case, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgement must be made by the appropriate healthcare professional(s) responsible for clinical decisions regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan. This judgement should only be arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment choices available. It is, however, advised that significant departures from the national guideline or any local guidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. </li>
    <li>Recommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations may be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product license. This is known as 'off label' use.
    <p>Medicines may be prescribed off label in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>For an indication not specified within the marketing authorisation </li>
        <li>For administration via a different route </li>
        <li>Or administration of a different dose </li>
        <li>For a different patient population </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans.</p>
    <p>Generally the off label use of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience.</p>
    <p>"Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescribers' professional responsibility and potential liability".</p>
    <p>The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that when prescribing a medicine off label, doctors should:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient's needs than an authorised alternative (if one exists). </li>
        <li>Be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicines to show its safety and efficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources. </li>
        <li>Record in the patient's clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice, the reasons for the choice. </li>
        <li>Take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient's care, including monitoring the effects of the medicine. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own professional prescribing standards.</p>
    <p>Prior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the summary of product characteristics (SPC). The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional code of ethics of their statutory bodies and the prescribing practices of their employers.</p>
    </li>

<p>Implementation of national clinical guidelines is the responsibility of each National Health Service (NHS) Board and is an essential part of clinical governance. Mechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guideline recommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate. Local arrangements should then be made to implement the national guideline in individual hospitals, units and practices.</p>
<p>Implementation of this guideline will be encouraged by Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and actively supported by the Chronic Pain Service Improvement Groups. The Scottish Government is supporting NHS boards to establish local Service Improvement Groups in a two year development programme that aims to implement the Scottish service model for chronic pain across Scotland (see Annex 5 in the original guideline document).</p>
