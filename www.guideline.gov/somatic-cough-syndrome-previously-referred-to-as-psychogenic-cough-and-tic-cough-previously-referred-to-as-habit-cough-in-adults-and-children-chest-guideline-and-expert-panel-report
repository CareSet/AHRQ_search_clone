                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C</strong>, <strong>consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In adults or children with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that the presence or absence of night time cough or cough with a barking or honking character should not be used to diagnose or exclude psychogenic or habit cough (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults with a persistently troublesome chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that the presence of depression and/or anxiety not be used as diagnostic criteria for psychogenic cough because patients with a persistently troublesome chronic cough can develop these psychologic symptoms when their coughs remain untreatable (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults and children with chronic cough that has remained medically unexplained after a comprehensive evaluation based upon the most current evidence-based management guideline, the Expert Panel recommends that the diagnosis of tic cough be made when the patient manifests the core clinical features of tics that include suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and the presence of a premonitory sensation whether the cough is single or one of many tics (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults and children with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests against using the diagnostic terms habit cough and psychogenic cough (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults and children with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests substituting the diagnostic term tic cough for habit cough to be consistent with the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, 5th edition (DSM-5) classification of diseases and because the definition and features of a tic capture the habitual nature of cough (<strong>CB</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: A simple cough tic in children may respond to suggestion therapy alone, as if it were just a "habit." A cough tic in isolation that persists for more than one year would be referred to by DSM-5 criteria as a chronic vocal tic disorder. This is distinct from Tourette syndrome that involves both motor and vocal tics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>When disseminating research findings on tic cough, the Expert Panel suggests adding the parenthetical term (<em>habit</em>) (e.g., tic cough [<em>habit</em>]) for three years, to help smooth the adoption of the new name, avoid confusion in the medical literature, and facilitate bibliographic database searches (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults and children, the Expert Panel suggests substituting the diagnostic term somatic cough disorder for psychogenic cough to be consistent with the DSM-5 classification of diseases (<strong>CB</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: The term "psychogenic" has disappeared from the DSM classification of diseases because functional imaging studies have started showing cerebral correlates for disorders previously thought to be of a pure psychogenic nature.</p>
    </li>
    <li>When disseminating research findings on somatic cough disorder, the Expert Panel suggests adding the parenthetical term (<em>psychogenic</em>) (e.g., somatic cough disorder [<em>psychogenic</em>]) for three years, to help smooth the adoption of the new name, avoid confusion in the medical literature, and facilitate bibliographic database searches (<strong>CB</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adults and children, the Expert Panel suggests that the diagnosis of somatic cough disorder can only be made after an extensive evaluation has been performed that includes ruling out tic disorders and uncommon causes and the patient meets the DSM-5 criteria (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) for a somatic symptom disorder (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In children with chronic cough diagnosed with somatic cough disorder (previously referred to as psychogenic cough), the Expert Panel suggests non-pharmacological trials of hypnosis or suggestion therapy or combinations of reassurance, counseling, or referral to a psychologist and/or psychiatrist (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>

                    <p>Searches of Electronic Databases</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Consistent with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, the Panel conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature to provide the evidence base for this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). This systematic review followed an a priori established protocol and summarized the evidence supporting different cough management options in adults and children with psychogenic, tic, and habit cough.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eligibility Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched for studies of any study design that enrolled children or adults with psychogenic cough, habit cough, and tic cough. They included studies regardless of their language or publication status. Case series with two or more patients were included. Single-case reports were excluded.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Identification</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers conducted a comprehensive search of several databases from each database's earliest inception to September 2013. The databases included Ovid Medline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid PsycINFO, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the guideline methodologist and selected members of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Expert Panel. The search used both controlled vocabulary and keywords. The strategy used is described in the online supplement of the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The reference lists from the narrative reviews and existing guidelines were searched, and consultation with experts in the field was performed to obtain any additional references that might have been missed by the electronic search strategy.</p>
<p>Reviewers working independently and in duplicate reviewed all abstracts. Upon retrieval of potentially eligible studies, the full-text publications were evaluated for eligibility. The chance-adjusted inter-reviewer agreement was calculated using the ĸ statistic for full text screening (ĸ=0.80). Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Update</span></strong></p>
<p>Since the publication of this review, the databases have been periodically searched to look for additional substantive articles. From September 2013 to January 9, 2015, an additional 135 citations were discovered by the search string of the systematic review that formed the basis for this guideline; none revealed any new or relevant information that affected the results or conclusions.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Number of Source Documents</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The review identified a total of 18 uncontrolled studies that had enrolled 223 patients, 96% consisting of children or adolescents, 54% of whom were female. The study selection process is depicted in Figure 1 in the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p>Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) has adopted the GRADE framework (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). This framework separates the process of rating the quality of evidence from that of determining the strength of recommendation. The quality of evidence is based on the five domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, reporting bias, and imprecision.</p>
<p>The quality of evidence (i.e., the confidence in estimates) is rated as high (A), moderate (B), or low or very low (C) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p>Systematic Review with Evidence Tables</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment </span></strong></p>
<p>Reviewers working independently and in duplicate analyzed the full text of eligible articles to assess the reported quality of the methods. Since all the included studies were case series, a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used. They assessed the following four elements: selection of patient, percent lost to follow-up, ascertainment of outcome, and length of follow-up.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Reviewers working independently and in duplicate used a standardized Internet-based form to extract for each eligible study the following data items: study design, study population, study main objective, number of patients, age, sex, number of children, description of cough (duration, frequency, severity, triggers, cough during sleep, and associated symptoms), validated cough assessment tools, impact on school or job, failure of conventional treatments, length of follow-up, and number of patients who improved with or failed the treatment.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p>Expert Consensus (Delphi)</p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The methodology used by the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guideline Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel Chair and the international panel of experts, perform the synthesis of the evidence, and develop the recommendations and suggestions has been published in the methodology and CHEST guideline development documents (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for this topic. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality and were used to support the evidence-based graded recommendations or suggestions. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. The total number of eligible voters for each guidance statement varied based on the number of managed individuals recused from voting on any particular statements because of their potential conflicts of interest. Transparency of process was documented. Further details of the methods have been published in the methodology and CHEST guideline development documents.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Framework</span></strong></p>
<p>CHEST has adopted the GRADE framework (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). This framework separates the process of rating the quality of evidence from that of determining the strength of recommendation. The quality of evidence is based on the five domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, reporting bias, and imprecision. The quality of evidence (i.e., the confidence in estimates) is rated as high (A), moderate (B), or low or very low (C). The strength of recommendation is determined based on the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and availability of resources. Recommendations can be strong or weak (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">State of the Available Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The systematic review only identified low-quality evidence to support a particular strategy to define and treat psychogenic, habit, and tic cough. Therefore, for diagnosis and management recommendations, the Panel heavily depended on patient values, preferences, and availability of potential therapies. The Panel considered available diagnostic criteria and reviewed the contemporary psychiatric and neurology literature and how it dealt with various terms. The Panel also made several suggestions for future research and terminology.</p></div></p>

<p>After publication, the guidelines were promoted to a wide audience of physicians, other health-care providers, and the public through multiple avenues. Press releases were prepared for both the lay and medical media, with major outreach efforts to all relevant print, broadcast, and Internet media. Panelists located in various large media markets were identified as potential spokespersons for interviews. Social media promotion was facilitated over Twitter, Facebook, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) e-Communities, internal and external blogs, and other communication routes. Blast communications were sent to CHEST members with links to the publication and postings on CHEST's Web site.</p>
<p>In addition to publication in <em>CHEST</em>, other derivative products were prepared to help with implementation, including slide sets, algorithms, and other clinical tools. These derivative products are posted on the CHEST Web site and will be made available in CHEST Guidelines. CHEST Guidelines will be the repository for the most current recommendations and suggestions from all CHEST guidelines, consensus statements, and hybrid documents. This online repository will also house a collection of related resources.</p>
<p>Associations that appointed representatives earlier in the process were asked to consider endorsing the approved guidelines for listing in the final publication. These organizations were requested to help promote the publication to their memberships through newsletters, Web sites, and other means.</p></div></p>
