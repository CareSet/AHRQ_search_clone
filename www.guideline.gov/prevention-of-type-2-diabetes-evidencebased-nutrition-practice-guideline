<p><strong>PDM: Coordination of Care</strong></p>
<p>For individuals who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes, the RDN should implement MNT and coordinate care with a multi-disciplinary team and important others (e.g., family, friends and colleagues) in a wide variety of settings. This approach is necessary to effectively integrate MNT into overall management for individuals who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>PDM: Monitoring and Evaluation in High-Risk Groups</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should monitor and evaluate the following, but not limited to, for individuals who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Glycemia (fasting blood glucose, two-hour post-prandial blood glucose and A1C) </li>
    <li>Anthropometrics (weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) </li>
    <li>CVD risk factors (lipid profile and blood pressure) </li>
    <li>Physical activity </li>
    <li>Medications and supplements </li>
    <li>Dietary factors </li>
</ul>
<p>These factors allow the RDN to evaluate the effectiveness of MNT for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in high-risk groups.</p>

<p><strong>Conditional vs Imperative Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations are categorized in terms of either <em><strong>conditional</strong></em> or <em><strong>imperative</strong></em> statements. While conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their application.</p>
<p>Conditional recommendations are presented in an if/then format, such that:</p>
<p>If CONDITION then ACTION(S) because REASON(S)</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the condition triggers one or more guideline-specified actions. In contrast, imperative recommendations include terms such as "require," "must," and "should," and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances.</p>

<p class="Note">*Conclusion statements are assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. Grade I is good; grade II, fair; grade III, limited; grade IV signifies expert opinion only and grade V indicates that a grade is not assignable because there is no evidence to support or refute the conclusion. The evidence and these grades are considered when assigning a rating (Strong, Fair, Weak, Consensus, Insufficient Evidence - see chart above) to a recommendation.</p>

<p>The following list provides an overview of the steps which the Academy evidence analysis team goes through to identify research through database searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Plan the search strategy</strong> to identify the current best evidence relevant to the question. The plan for identification and inclusion of articles and reports should be systematic and reproducible, not haphazard. Write out the original search strategy and document adjustments to the strategy if they occur. Allow for several iterations of searches.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>List inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>. The work group will define the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria will be used in defining the search strategy and for filtering the identified research reports. The Academy uses only peer-reviewed research; that is, articles accepted for evidence analysis must be peer-reviewed and published in a juried publication. Additionally, the Academy only uses human subjects in its research and does not include animal studies in its evidence analysis. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify search words</strong>. During the process of considering outcomes, interventions, nutrition diagnoses, and assessments, the work group may have identified a number of specific terms or factors that were important, but were not included in the actual question. These terms can be used as additional search terms to help identify relevant pieces of research. Both text word search and keyword search using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) definitions may be used. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify databases to search</strong>. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Agricola, DARE, TRIP, AHRQ and ERIC are some common databases for clinical nutritional research. Note that search terms can vary depending on the database. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conduct the search</strong>. Depending on the number and type of sources found in the initial search, adjustments might have to be made in the search strategy and to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and additional searches run. Changes to the search plan should be recorded for future reference. Document the number of sources identified in each search. </li>
    <li><strong>Review titles and abstracts</strong>. At this point, a filtering procedure is used to determine whether a research article matches the inclusion criteria and is relevant to the work group's questions. Typically, the lead analyst, along with a member of the expert workgroup, first reviews the citations and abstracts to filter out reports that are not applicable to the question. If a determination cannot be made based on the citation and abstract, then the full text of the article is obtained for review. </li>
    <li><strong>Gather all remaining articles and reports</strong>. Obtain paper or electronic copies of research articles that remain on the list following the citation and abstract review. If there are less than six citations, it could mean that the search was too specific to identify relevant research or that research has not been done on this topic. A broadened search should be tried. When there is a long list of citations, ascertain whether it includes articles that are tangential to the question or address the question in only a general way. In this case a more focused search strategy may be necessary. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Formulate Evidence Analysis Question</strong></p>
<p>Specify a question in a defined area of practice or state a tentative conclusion or recommendation that is being considered. Include the patient type and special needs of the target population involved, the alternatives under consideration, and the outcomes of interest (PICO format).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Gather and Classify Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Conduct a systematic search of the literature to find evidence related to the question, gather studies and reports, and classify them by type of evidence. Classes differentiate primary reports of new data according to study design, and distinguish them from secondary reports that include systematic and/or narrative review.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Critically Appraise Each Article</strong></p>
<p>Review each article for relevance to the question and use the checklist of questions to evaluate the research design and implementation. Abstract key information from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Summarize Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Synthesize the reports into an overview table and summarize the research relevant to the question.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Write and Grade the Conclusion Statement</strong></p>
<p>Develop a concise conclusion statement (the answer to the question). Assign a grade to indicate the overall strength or weakness of evidence informing the conclusion statement (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline-Specific Methods</span></strong> </p>
<p>The following major outcomes were considered in the analysis:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Glycemic outcomes (specifically fasting blood glucose, 2 hour post prandial blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C]) </li>
    <li>Lipid outcomes (specifically triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol levels) </li>
    <li>Anthropometric outcomes (specifically waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio) </li>
    <li>Blood pressure outcomes (specifically systolic and diastolic blood pressure) </li>
    <li>Renal outcomes (specifically urinary albumin excretion rate and albumin:creatinine ratio). </li>
</ul>
<p>These outcomes are the diagnostic markers of prediabetes (as defined by the American Diabetes Association) and/or metabolic syndrome (as defined by the Third Adult Treatment Panel [ATP III] or the World Health Organization [WHO]). In addition, based on the Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: The Role of Nutrition in Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention, obesity and family history are the main predictors of type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, low HDL cholesterol levels and high triglyceride levels are also predictive of type 2 diabetes risk.</p>
<p>The focus of this analysis was to separate out the impact of each intervention, on specified outcomes, without the influence of weight loss. The evidence analysis, on the impact of specific interventions, was based on randomized controlled trials (class A), cohort trials (class B) and nonrandomized clinical studies (class C) that control for the impact of significant weight loss, meaning that one of the following existed in each study included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>No statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) weight loss occurred between or within groups during the course of the study. </li>
    <li>Statistically significant weight loss occurred between or within groups, but it was controlled for in the statistical analysis. </li>
    <li>Statistically significant weight loss was similar between and within groups, but the interventions studied were different. </li>
</ul>
<p>In taking this approach, any studies resulting in weight loss (such as the landmark studies on prevention of type 2 diabetes) only appear in the evidence analysis for weight loss (and possibly medical nutrition therapy if the intervention was provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist). For the evidence analysis on weight loss, a Cochrane review published in 2008 which included the landmark studies on prevention of type 2 diabetes (such as the Diabetes Prevention Program, Finnish DPS, Indian DPP, Da Qing IGT and Diabetes Study, etc.) was included to represent these historical findings, and more recently published research was added to the evidence analysis.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Development of Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert work group, which includes practitioners and researchers with a depth of experience in the specific field of interest, develops the disease-specific guideline. The guideline development involves the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Review the Conclusion Statements</strong>: The work group meets to review the materials resulting from the evidence analysis, which may include conclusion statements, evidence summaries, and evidence worksheets. </li>
    <li><strong>Formulate Recommendations for the Guideline Integrating Conclusions from Evidence Analysis</strong>: The work group uses an expert consensus method to formulate the guideline recommendations and complete the various sections on the recommendation page. These include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Recommendation(s)</strong>: This is a course of action for the practitioner. The recommendation is written using two brief and separate statements. The first statement is "what" the dietitian should do or not do. The second statement describes the "why" of the recommendation. More than one recommendation may be formulated depending on a particular topic and the supporting conclusion statements. </li>
        <li><strong>Rating</strong>: The rating for the recommendation is based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The grade of the supporting conclusion statement(s) will help determine this rating (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). </li>
        <li><strong>Label of Conditional or Imperative</strong>: Each recommendation will have a label of "conditional" or "imperative." Conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, while imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population without restraints on their pertinence. </li>
        <li><strong>Risks and Harms of Implementing the Recommendations</strong>: Includes any potential risks, anticipated harms or adverse consequences associated with applying the recommendation(s) to the target population. </li>
        <li><strong>Conditions of Application</strong>: Includes any organizational barriers or changes that would need to be made within an organization to apply the recommendation in daily practice. Also includes any conditions which may limit the application of the recommendation(s). For instance, application may be limited to only people in an inpatient setting, or not applicable for pregnant women. Facilitators for the application of the guideline may also be listed here. Conditional recommendations will always have conditions specified. Imperative recommendations may have some general conditions for application. </li>
        <li><strong>Potential Costs Associated with Application</strong>: Includes any costs that may be associated with the application of this recommendation such as specialized staff, new equipment or treatments. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Narrative</strong>: Provides a brief description of the evidence that supports this recommendation. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong>: Provides a brief list of the evidence strength and methodological issues that determined the recommendation strength. </li>
        <li><strong>Minority Opinions</strong>: If the expert work group cannot reach consensus on the recommendation, the minority opinions may be listed here. </li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Evidence</strong>: Provides links to the conclusions statements, evidence summaries and worksheets related to the formulation of this recommendation(s). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process</strong>: Recommendations are based on the summarized evidence from the analysis. Sources that are not analyzed during the evidence analysis process may be used to support and formulate the recommendation or to support information under other categories on the recommendation page, if the workgroup deems necessary. References must be credible resources (e.g., consensus reports, other guidelines, position papers, standards of practice, articles from peer-reviewed journals, nationally recognized documents or websites). If recommendations are based solely on these types of references, they will be rated as "consensus." Occasionally recommendations will include references that were not reviewed during the evidence analysis process but are relevant to the recommendation, risks and harms of implementing the recommendation, conditions of application, or potential costs associated with application. These references will be listed on the recommendation page under "References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process." </li>
    <li><strong>Develop a Clinical Algorithm for The Guideline</strong>: The workgroup develops a clinical algorithm based on Academy's Nutrition Care Process, to display how each recommendation can be used within the treatment process and how they relate to the Nutrition Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete the Writing of the Guideline</strong>: Each disease-specific guideline has a similar format which incorporates the Introduction (includes: Scope of the Guideline, Statement of Intent, Guideline Methods, Implementation, Benefits and Risks/Harms of Implementation), Background Information and any necessary Appendices. The work group develops these features. </li>
    <li><strong>Criteria Used in Guideline Development</strong>: The criteria used in determining the format and process for development of Academy's guidelines are based on the following tools and criteria for evidence-based guidelines:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Guideline Elements Model (GEM) which has been incorporated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a Standard Specification for clinical practice guidelines. </li>
        <li>Appraisal for Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument </li>

<p class="Note">*Conclusion statements are assigned a grade based on the
strength of the evidence. Grade I is good; grade II, fair; grade III,
limited; grade IV signifies expert opinion only and grade V indicates
that a grade is not assignable because there is no evidence to support
or refute the conclusion. The evidence and these grades are considered
when assigning a rating (Strong, Fair, Weak, Consensus, Insufficient
Evidence - see chart above) to a recommendation.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Benefits</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A primary goal of implementing these recommendations includes improving a person's ability to achieve optimal nutrition through healthful food choices and a physically-active lifestyle. </li>
    <li>Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT is essential for improved outcomes. </li>
    <li>MNT education can be considered cost-effective when considering the benefits of nutrition interventions on the onset and progression of comorbidities versus the cost of the intervention. </li>
</ul></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overall Risk/Harm Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>When using these recommendations, consider the following general risks and harms:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patient's age, socio-economic status (SES), cultural issues, psychosocial and mental health status, health history and other individual and health conditions </li>
    <li>Use clinical judgment in applying the guidelines <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation-Specific Risks/Harms</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Screening for Type 2 Diabetes Risk</strong></p>
<p>There is a potential for negative psychological effect from screening for diabetes risk (for example, emotional distress and denial).</p>
<p><strong>Weight Loss</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Reduction of caloric intake may result in nutritional inadequacies; therefore, special attention should be paid to maintaining adequate intake of vitamins and minerals. </li>
    <li>Adverse risks may be associated with pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Glycemic Index/Glycemic Load</strong></p>
<p>The registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should be aware that the relationship between consumption of low-glycemic index foods and plasma glucose concentration is complex and is altered by the protein and fat composition of a meal, preparation and processing of the food items, prior food intake, fasting or preprandial plasma glucose levels and degree of insulin resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Activity</strong></p>
<p>Intense physical activity in some overweight and obese individuals may contribute to disability or death; thus, consultation with a physician prior to beginning an exercise program should be recommended.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Qualifying Statements</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This nutrition practice guideline is meant to serve as a general framework for handling clients with particular health problems. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended for use by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) involved in providing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for individuals who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The application of the guideline must be individualized to assist the RDN to successfully integrate MNT into the overall medical management of persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes. </li>
    <li>While the evidence-based nutrition practice guidelines represent a statement of promising practice based on the latest available evidence at the time of publication, the guideline is not intended to overrule professional judgment. Rather, it may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. These nutrition practice guidelines are provided with the express understanding that they do not establish or specify particular standards of care, whether legal, medical or other. </li>
    <li>This guideline recognizes the role of patient and family preferences for possible outcomes of care, when the appropriateness of a clinical intervention involves a substantial element of personal choice or values. With regard to types of evidence that are associated with particular outcomes, two major classes have been described. Patient-oriented evidence that matters (POEM) deals with outcomes of importance to patients, such as changes in morbidity, mortality or quality of life. Disease-oriented evidence (DOE) deals with surrogate end-points, such as changes in laboratory values or other measures of response. Although the results of DOE sometimes parallel the results of POEM, they do not always correspond. When possible, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends using POEM-type evidence rather than DOE. When DOE is the only guidance available, the guideline indicates that key clinical recommendations lack the support of outcomes evidence. </li>
</ul></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The publication of this guideline is an integral part of the plans for getting the Academy Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) evidence-based recommendations on prevention of type 2 diabetes to all dietetics practitioners engaged in, teaching about or researching the topic. National implementation workshops at various sites around the country and during the Academy Food Nutrition Conference &amp; Expo (FNCE) are planned. Additionally, there are recommended dissemination and adoption strategies for local use of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline.</p>
<p>The guideline development team recommended multi-faceted strategies to disseminate the guideline and encourage its implementation. Management support and learning through social influence are likely to be effective in implementing guidelines in dietetic practice. However, additional interventions may be needed to achieve real change in practice routines.</p>
<p>Implementation of the guideline will be achieved by announcement at professional events, presentations and training. Some strategies include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>National and local events</strong>: State dietetic association meetings and media coverage will help launch the guideline. </li>
    <li><strong>Local feedback adaptation</strong>: Presentation by members of the work group at peer review meetings and opportunities for continuing education units (CEUs) for courses completed. </li>
    <li><strong>Education initiatives</strong>: The guideline and supplementary resources will be freely available for use in the education and training of dietetic interns and students in approved Commission on Accreditation of Dietetics Education (CADE) programs. </li>
    <li><strong>Champions</strong>: Local champions will be identified and expert members of the recommendation team will prepare articles for publications. Resources will be provided that include PowerPoint presentations, full guidelines and pre-prepared case studies. </li>
    <li><strong>Practical tools</strong>: Some of the tools that will be developed to help implement the guideline include specially designed resources such as clinical algorithms, slide presentations, training and toolkits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific distribution strategies include:</p>
<p><strong>Publication in full</strong>: The guideline is available electronically at the <a href="/web/20180712184231/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48762&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.andeal.org%2fdefault.cfm%3f" title="AND Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site">Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712184231im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> and announced to all Academy Dietetic Practice Groups. The Academy's Evidence Analysis Library will also provide downloadable supporting information and links to relevant position papers.</p></div></p>
