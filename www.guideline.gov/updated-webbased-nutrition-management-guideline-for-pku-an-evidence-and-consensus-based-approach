                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of the recommendations (<strong>Strong, Fair, Weak, Consensus, Insufficient Evidence</strong>) and need for clinical action (<strong>Imperative, Conditional</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrient Intake</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>For individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), what nutrient intakes are associated with positive outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Meet the individual's recommended phenylalanine (PHE) intake (for anabolism and maintaining an appropriate blood PHE concentration) by adjusting intact protein intake. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Provide a total protein intake (from a combination of intact protein and amino acid-based medical food) approximately 50% higher than the dietary reference intake (DRI) for infants and children from birth to 4 years of age and 20% to 40% higher than the DRI for those over 4 years of age. The amount of medical food prescribed is based on the difference between the total protein recommendation and the intact protein allowance. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Provide supplemental tyrosine (TYR) if blood TYR concentrations are consistently below the normal range. (<strong>Fair, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>With the exception of recommended intake for protein, PHE, and TYR, individuals with PKU should meet the same DRI for age- and gender-specific nutrient/micronutrients and energy as healthy individuals in the general population. (<strong>Weak, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blood PHE Concentrations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>For individuals with PKU, what blood PHE concentrations are associated with positive outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Maintain lifelong blood PHE between 120 and 360 &mu;mol/L. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Treatment should be initiated in individuals with PKU whose blood PHE exceeds 360 &mu;mol/L. (<strong>Weak, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strategies for Nutrition Intervention</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>For individuals with PKU, which nutrition interventions are associated with positive outcome?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Choose medical foods to meet recommended nutrient intake and achieve optimal adherence. When incomplete medical foods are chosen, ensure that vitamin, mineral, energy, and/or fat intake is supplemented from other sources when necessary. (<strong>Weak, Imperative</strong>) </p>
<p>Plan consumption of medical food throughout the day, in several well-spaced intervals, to allow optimal blood PHE concentrations and dietary PHE tolerance. (<strong>Strong, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Encourage use of breast milk, when possible, either from direct breast feeding or use of expressed breast milk, as the source of PHE (and intact protein) in infants. (<strong>Fair, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Gradually introduce solids, to replace the equivalent amount of PHE/intact protein in infant formula or breast milk, when the infant is developmentally ready (usually at 4&ndash;6 months of age). (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Minimize elevation of blood PHE during illness by treating the underlying illness, meeting protein and energy needs, and preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. (<strong>Consensus, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Ensure appropriate PHE intake in individuals with PKU by having accurate data regarding PHE content of foods, and effective and convenient methods of planning and monitoring dietary PHE intake. (<strong>Weak, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Encourage all individuals to follow treatment recommendations throughout their lives; including those who have relaxed their diet restrictions and those who have never been treated. Recognize and address individual barriers that may impede success. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Adopt clinic procedures that enhance adherence to the nutritional recommendations of "diet for life" by providing individualized educational strategies, referrals to appropriate social service and mental health professionals, age-appropriate group activities, and a plan for transition from pediatric to adult clinical services. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitoring Nutrition Intervention</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>For individuals with PKU, monitoring of which parameters is associated with positive outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Monitor dietary records to assess adequacy of nutrient intake in supporting appropriate growth and nutritional status. If intake is suboptimal, modify individual dietary recommendations and counseling to improve adherence. (<strong>Strong, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Monitor age-specific anthropometrics. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Routinely monitor clinical indicators and biochemical markers for deficiency or excess of nutrients whose intake may not be optimal in an individual on a PHE-restricted diet (PHE, TYR, protein, iron and vitamin D). (<strong>Strong, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Monitor clinical indicators and biochemical markers when indicated by circumstances such as rapid growth, pregnancy, poor compliance with management recommendations, or consumption of an incomplete medical food. (<strong>Fair, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Monitor neurocognitive development. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Assess quality of life using age- and disorder-specific instruments when possible. (<strong>Weak, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrition Intervention with Alternative or Adjunctive Therapies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>For individuals with PKU whose therapy includes adjunctive therapy or other therapy options (sapropterin or large neutral amino acids [LNNA]), what dietary considerations are needed for positive outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>When treatment with sapropterin (pregnancy class C) is appropriate, combine with diet therapy to improve blood PHE and/or clinical status, and develop individualized therapy plans to provide best outcome. (<strong>Strong, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Conduct a PHE challenge to determine maximal dietary PHE tolerance when sapropterin response brings blood PHE to within control range, or to clarify a sapropterin response when historical blood PHE is already within control range. (<strong>Strong, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Modify dietary therapy in individuals responsive to sapropterin to accommodate increased PHE tolerance. Liberalization should reflect increased PHE/intact protein intake, decreased medical food intake, and vitamin/mineral supplementation as appropriate. Monitor nutritional status and educate individuals regarding modified dietary recommendations. (<strong>Strong, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Individualize and closely monitor sapropterin therapy when used in special populations, such as: infants and young children, pregnancy, and late- or untreated adults. (<strong>Weak, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Consider LNAA supplementation in adults with PKU who are unable to achieve metabolic control with diet or other adjunctive therapy. LNAA therapy is not recommended for use in infants, young children, or women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. (<strong>Weak, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>When LNAA therapy is chosen, provide 20% to 30% of total protein intake from LNAA supplements, and the remaining 70% to 80% from intact dietary protein. Total protein intake should meet DRI requirements (0.8 g/kg/day). Monitor adequacy of protein intake and plasma amino acids to prevent essential amino acid deficiencies. (<strong>Weak, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrition Intervention Before, During, and After Pregnancy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>For women with PKU, what nutritional therapies are associated with positive outcomes during pregnancy planning, pregnancy, and the postpartum period (including lactation)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Maintain blood PHE between 120 and 360 &mu;mol/L before, during, and after pregnancy. (<strong>Strong, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Monitor weight gain, dietary intake, and biochemical parameters to ensure nutrient adequacy and metabolic control during pregnancy. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Prescribe a diet that meets nutritional needs of pregnancy and promotes adequate weight gain. (<strong>Fair, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Avoid LNAA monotherapy during pregnancy. (<strong>Consensus, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Use of sapropterin should be evaluated during pregnancy on a case-by-case basis, and may be appropriate especially in women with moderate or mild forms of PKU who are not able to maintain blood PHE in the recommended treatment range for pregnancy. (<strong>Consensus, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Facilitate access to psychosocial support as necessary to maintain dietary therapy in pregnancy. (<strong>Consensus, Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>Encourage women with PKU to maintain dietary therapy after pregnancy and to breast-feed their infants. (<strong>Weak, Imperative</strong>)</p>
<p>Modify PKU therapy and collaborate with other care-givers to support nutritional and metabolic needs of women with multiple pregnancies, gestational diabetes, and other special circumstances. (<strong>Insufficient evidence, Conditional</strong>)</p>

<p>The search process, critical appraisal and abstraction, and consensus input and evidence summary were previously described in the Maple Syrup Urine Disease guidelines and are outlined on the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (GMDI)/Southeast Regional Newborn Screening and Genetics Consortium (SERC) portal (<a href="/web/20180712203144/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50488&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fGMDI.org%2f" title="GMDI Web site">https://GMDI.org/</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203144im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). PubMed searches included human studies (excluding genetic studies not related to treatment) published in English from 1980 to late 2000 and from 2011 to February 2014. Studies published from 2000 through 2010 were reviewed and summarized for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) State of the Science Conference (February 2013) by dietitians who were members of the NIH Diet Management Working Group or Maternal PKU Working Group, and who were also involved in this GMDI/SERC guideline effort. The summary statement from the State of the Science Conference is referenced in the guideline in lieu of individual articles used in preparation of the summary statement. Literature reviewed for the published companion American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) Guidelines and GMDI/SERC Recommendations are similarly referenced.</p>
<p>Gray literature refers to resources that cannot be accessed through standard search systems. These include abstracts and presentations from scientific meetings, clinical protocols and guidelines, unpublished research, communication among experts (including list-serves), professional newsletters, and book chapters. Gray literature related to phenylketonuria (PKU) was collected by work group members and was screened and prioritized for inclusion based on relevance, currency, and substantive information not available in scientific literature.</p>

<p>Each peer-reviewed publication was critically reviewed by a trained analyst using a Quality Criteria Checklist adapted for this purpose. Quality criteria included selection and retention of subjects, appropriate controls, intervention clearly described, other intervening variables tracked, outcomes defined, measures valid and statistical analyses appropriate. Based on the number of criteria met, each article was given a quality rating of positive, neutral or negative. Workgroup members were assigned articles pertinent to a particular research question, which they reviewed and abstracted. Description included: study sample, intervention or factors of interest, findings, limitations of the study, and the article's contribution to the evidence analysis research question.</p>
<p>Workgroup members, using a specially designed tool, subjected eligible gray literature to similar quality assessment and abstraction.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Key information from all eligible evidence sources (peer-reviewed and gray literature) for each question was summarized. Summarized evidence was used to draft preliminary conclusion statements and recommendations.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>Topics for evidence analysis were selected from areas of uncertainty and variation in practice by a phenylketonuria (PKU) working group comprised of ten experienced metabolic dietitians. Six practice-based questions were identified for evidence analysis and guideline development (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Research questions were formulated in the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) format, and a separate systematic literature search, appraisal, and evidence analysis and summary was completed for each question.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Key information from all eligible evidence sources (peer-reviewed and gray literature) for each question was summarized. Summarized evidence was used to draft preliminary conclusion statements and recommendations.</p>
<p>Through two separate Delphi surveys and a nominal group process meeting, clinical expertise was gathered regarding practices not addressed sufficiently in the literature, or for which evidence was inconclusive. The goal was to develop consensus or to note where consensus does not exist. Participants in the Delphi survey were metabolic dietitians and metabolic physicians representing all geographical regions in the U.S. Participants in the nominal group meeting included: a general pediatrician, a researcher, and an advocate for the PKU community, in addition to metabolic physicians and dietitians.</p>
<p>The final conclusion statement for each research question is based on a synthesis of evidence from peer-reviewed publications, gray literature, and Delphi and nominal group consensus techniques.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development</span></strong></p>
<p>The final conclusion statement and recommendations for the nutrition management of individuals with PKU in each of the six topic areas were based on synthesis of all evidence and consensus sources. These were written, reviewed, and edited by the project core group. A guideline consultant, not involved in developing the recommendations, and with input from principal investigators (PIs) and co-PIs with domain expertise, rated each recommendation with respect to strength of the evidence behind the recommendation (strong, fair, limited, consensus, insufficient evidence) and need for clinical action (imperative [i.e., broadly applicable to individuals with PKU] or conditional [i.e., applicable in specific situations]). Definitions for strength of evidence and clinical action ratings are described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This guideline recommends that individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) maintain blood phenylalanine (PHE) between 120 and 360 &mu;mol/L through their lifetime. Unnecessary treatment, or more stringent treatment than needed for optimal outcomes, has the potential to create psychosocial costs for individuals with PKU. Such treatment may be burdensome and stigmatizing, may have nutritional consequences (vitamin/mineral/protein deficiencies), and may increase health care costs, especially since access to medical foods and care is difficult for many. Many older children and adults currently do not adhere well to more liberal blood PHE recommendations so may be unlikely to attain more strict blood PHE recommendations.</p>
<p>Individuals who do not adhere to all aspects of therapy are also at risk for the consequences of elevated blood PHE and possible nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p>Side effects of sapropterin, used as an adjuvant therapy, include gastrointestinal distress (especially if the drug is not consumed with food) and headaches. The safety of use during pregnancy and lactation in women with PKU is still being studied.</p>
<p>While large neutral amino acids, used as an adjuvant therapy, have allowed improvement in psychosocial characteristics in some individuals with PKU, they do not result in blood PHE in the target range.</p></div></p>
