                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the Levels of Certainty regarding Net Benefit (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 years or older. (<strong>A recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends obtaining measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older without known hypertension.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p><em>Office Blood Pressure Measurement</em></p>
<p>Office measurement of blood pressure is most commonly done with a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. Little research has been done on the best approach to measuring blood pressure in the office setting. Most clinical trials of hypertension treatment, at a minimum, used the mean of 2 measurements taken while the patient was seated (some used the mean of the second and third measurements), allowed for at least 5 minutes between entry into the office and blood pressure measurement, used an appropriately sized arm cuff, and placed the patient's arm at the level of the right atrium during measurement. Multiple measurements over time have better positive predictive value for hypertension than a single measurement. Automated office blood pressure, which is an average of multiple automated measurements taken while the patient is alone in a room, may yield results similar to those of daytime ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Blood pressure is affected by various short-term factors, such as emotions, stress, pain, physical activity, and drugs (including caffeine and nicotine). In addition to within-patient temporal variability, isolated clinic hypertension in the medical setting and in the presence of medical personnel (known as "white coat" hypertension) is well-documented. Epidemiologic data suggest that 15% to 30% of the population believed to have hypertension may have lower blood pressure outside of the office setting. The disadvantages of diagnosing hypertension solely in the office setting include measurement errors, the limited number of measurements that can be made conveniently, and the confounding risk for isolated clinic hypertension.</p>
<p><em>Ambulatory and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring</em></p>
<p>In addition to office blood pressure measurement, ABPM and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) may be used to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening. ABPM devices are small, portable machines that record blood pressure at regular intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities and while they are sleeping. Measurements are typically taken at 20- to 30-minute intervals. HBPM devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient's brachial artery. Many of these devices are available for retail purchase, and some have undergone technical validation according to recommended protocols.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found convincing evidence that ABPM is the best method for diagnosing hypertension. Although the criteria for establishing hypertension varied across studies, there was significant discordance between the office diagnosis of hypertension and 12- and 24-hour average blood pressures using ABPM, with significantly fewer patients requiring treatment based on ABPM (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). Elevated ambulatory systolic blood pressure was consistently and significantly associated with increased risk for fatal and nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular events, independent of office blood pressure (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document). For these reasons, the USPSTF recommends ABPM as the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension.</p>
<p>Good-quality evidence suggests that confirmation of hypertension with HBPM may be acceptable. Several studies showed that elevated home blood pressure was significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality, independent of office blood pressure (see Figure 4 in the original guideline document). However, fewer studies have compared HBPM with office blood pressure measurement, so the evidence is not as substantial as it is for ABPM. Therefore, the USPSTF considers ABPM to be the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. However, the USPSTF acknowledges that the use of ABPM may be problematic in some situations. HBPM using appropriate protocols is an alternative method of confirmation if ABPM is not available. Measurements from the office, HBPM, and ABPM must be interpreted with care and in the context of the individual patient. Patients with very high blood pressure or signs of end-organ damage may need immediate treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends annual screening for adults aged 40 years or older and for those who are at increased risk for high blood pressure. Persons at increased risk include those who have high-normal blood pressure (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg), those who are overweight or obese, and African Americans. Adults aged 18 to 39 years with normal blood pressure (&lt;130/85 mm Hg) who do not have other risk factors should be rescreened every 3 to 5 years. The USPSTF recommends rescreening with properly measured office blood pressure and, if blood pressure is elevated, confirming the diagnosis of hypertension with ABPM.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of treatment of hypertension in preventing important health outcomes are well documented. Moderate- to high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of the general population of persons aged 60 years or older to a target blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease events. Similarly, RCTs demonstrate the efficacy of treatment of younger adults to a target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg in reducing cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and overall mortality. In the absence of sufficient RCT data, expert opinion has been used to establish a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg in adults younger than 60 years, and some experts believe that this should also be maintained in those aged 60 years or older. However, published results from a recently completed large RCT, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, are not yet available to inform current treatment goals. Clinicians should consult updated blood pressure treatment guidelines informed by this trial as they become available.</p>
<p>For nonblack patients, initial treatment consists of a thiazide diuretic, calcium-channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin-receptor blocker. For black patients, initial treatment is thiazide or a calcium-channel blocker. Initial or add-on treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease consists of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (not both).</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators searched MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL from 2003 through August 8, 2014 to update benefits and harms of screening for high blood pressure. EPC staff searched the same databases (excluding CINAHL) through February 24, 2014 as follows: starting in 1992 (to allow for implementation of the first guidelines for validation of blood pressure monitoring devices) for prediction of cardiovascular events by blood pressure method and diagnostic accuracy of nonoffice measurement, and starting in 1966 (the beginning of MEDLINE) for rescreening interval. On the basis of the findings from these updated searches, they did not further update them because any studies found would probably not have changed the overall conclusions. The investigators also searched bibliographies of relevant reviews, included studies, and publication lists of highly referenced studies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Study Selection</strong></span></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles against prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. They required all studies to have enrolled untreated adults and to have been conducted in countries rated as "very high" on the 2013 Human Development Index. For prediction of cardiovascular events, the investigators allowed studies that included treated patients because a proportion of persons followed over time would inevitably begin treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) devices were eligible for use in confirming an initially elevated office blood pressure measurement result. For screening benefits and harms, cardiovascular events were analyzed and included fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction; sudden cardiac death; stroke; heart failure; atrial fibrillation; transient ischemic attack; end-stage kidney disease; or a composite of any of the aforementioned events, excluding cardiovascular symptoms, angina, revascularization, carotid intima&ndash;media thickness, and left ventricular hypertrophy.</p>
<p>For diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement, the investigators included studies that compared different office-based devices or measurement protocols and reported sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or concordance (for example, ĸ). For diagnostic accuracy of confirmatory blood pressure measurement methods, eligible study populations had an initial elevated office blood pressure at screening, which allowed for reporting or calculation of the positive predictive value (PPV).</p>
<p>For prediction of cardiovascular events, eligible studies followed a cohort of patients over time and reported the associations (hazard or risk ratios) of blood pressure as a continuous variable, measured by at least 2 methods at baseline, with data on overall mortality or cardiovascular events collected during follow-up. For rescreening interval, the investigators included studies that followed cohorts of initially nonhypertensive adults over time and reported hypertension incidence at rescreening intervals of up to 6 years.</p></div></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>One investigator abstracted data from all included studies, and a second checked for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed the quality of included studies by using predefined, design-specific criteria. They rated study quality as good, fair, or poor and excluded all poor-quality studies. The investigators resolved disagreements about quality through discussion with a third investigator. Where reported, studies with various threats to internal validity were downgraded to fair-quality according to USPSTF standards.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators qualitatively described the results on the benefits and harms of screening. Per the protocol, they first calculated the diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement by using the recommendations of the American Heart Association as the reference standard because there is no gold standard for blood pressure measurement. With the subsequent identification of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as the best predictor of cardiovascular events, they calculated the diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement and confirmatory blood pressure measurement methods by using ABPM as the reference standard where possible. The investigators qualitatively described all diagnostic accuracy results because data were insufficient for quantitative synthesis.</p>
<p>For prediction of cardiovascular events, the investigators combined fatal and nonfatal events within outcome categories (cardiovascular, stroke, and cardiac). Risk was most commonly reported as the hazard ratio associated with each 10&ndash;mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure and each 5&ndash;mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure. They converted hazard ratios to these common increments if they were reported differently. The investigators depicted the hazard ratios in forest plots for qualitative evaluation; because of the small numbers of studies for each outcome and heterogeneity across studies, they did not calculate summary meta-analytic estimates of risk to determine the best blood pressure measurement method for prediction. The investigators conducted exploratory meta-analyses to compare ABPM protocols (24-hour, daytime, and nighttime) by generating estimates of cardiovascular events or mortality risk for each protocol by using the DerSimonian&ndash;Laird random effects method. In sensitivity analyses, these results were compared to estimates generated by using profile likelihood and Knapp&ndash;Hartung methods.</p>
<p>For rescreening, the investigators pooled reported incidence rates across all studies to generate a weighted mean incidence at yearly intervals (reported within &plusmn;0.5 year). They qualitatively examined within-study comparisons among a priori subgroups of age, blood pressure, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>When constructing the overall summary of evidence (see Appendix Table 1 in the systematic review), the investigators evaluated included studies within the context of each review question for consistency of results for important outcomes and relevance to primary care.</p></div></p>

<p class="Note">*<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the Task Force constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></span></p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 23 December 2014 to 26 January 2015. The USPSTF reviewed all public comments received in response. The USPSTF acknowledges the current barriers to implementation of its recommendation, including the availability and affordability of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). In response, it revised the final recommendation to include home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) as an alternative for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension when ABPM is not feasible. The USPSTF also provided more information on the implementation of diagnostic confirmation and industry standards for home blood pressure monitors.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</strong></span></p>
<p>Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: the Seventh Joint National Committee; the Eighth Joint National Committee; the American Heart Association; the American Academy of Family Physicians; and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p></div></p>

    <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specific clinical preventive services for patients without related signs or symptoms. </li>
    <li>It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the benefits and harms of the service and an assessment of the balance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a service in this assessment. </li>
    <li>The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence but individualize decision making to the specific patient or situation. Similarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and coverage decisions involve considerations in addition to the evidence of clinical benefits and harms. </li>
    <li>Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an ofﬁcial position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="/web/20180713041832/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49877&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2fPage%2fName%2fmethods-and-processes" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713041832im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size <em>Guide to Clinical Preventive Services</em>.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div></p>
