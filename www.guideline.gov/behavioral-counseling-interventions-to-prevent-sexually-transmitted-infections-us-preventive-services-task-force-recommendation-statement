                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, D,</strong> or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the levels of certainty regarding net benefit (<strong>High, Moderate,</strong> and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). (<strong>B recommendation</strong>) See the "Clinical Considerations" section below for a description of high-risk populations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and to adults who are at increased risk for acquiring or transmitting STIs.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>All sexually active adolescents are at increased risk for STIs and should be counseled. Other risk groups that have been included in counseling studies are adults with current STIs or other infections within the past year, adults who have multiple sex partners, and adults who do not consistently use condoms.</p>
<p>Clinicians should be aware of populations with a particularly high prevalence of STIs. African Americans have the highest STI prevalence of any racial/ethnic group, and prevalence is higher in American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Latinos than in white persons. Increased STI prevalence rates are also found in men who have sex with men (MSM), persons with low incomes living in urban settings, current or former inmates, military recruits, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, persons with mental illness or a disability, current or former intravenous drug users, persons with a history of sexual abuse, and patients at public STI clinics.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Behavioral counseling interventions can reduce a person's likelihood of acquiring an STI. Interventions ranging in intensity from 30 minutes to 2 or more hours of contact time are beneficial. Evidence of benefit increases with intervention intensity. High-intensity counseling interventions (defined in the review as contact time of &ge;2 hours) were the most effective, moderate-intensity interventions (defined as 30 to 120 minutes) were less consistently beneficial, and low-intensity interventions (defined as &lt;30 minutes) were the least effective. Interventions can be delivered by primary care clinicians or through referral to trained behavioral counselors.</p>
<p>Most successful approaches provided basic information about STIs and STI transmission; assessed the person's risk for transmission; and provided training in pertinent skills, such as condom use, communication about safe sex, problem solving, and goal setting. Many successful interventions used a targeted approach to the age, sex, and ethnicity of the participants and also aimed to increase motivation or commitment to safe sex practices. Intervention methods included face-to-face counseling, videos, written materials, and telephone support. The USPSTF did not find enough evidence to determine whether the following intervention characteristics were related independently to effectiveness: degree of cultural tailoring, group versus individual format, condom negotiation or other communication as an intervention component, counselor characteristics, setting, or type of control group.</p>
<p><strong>Other Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF has issued several recommendations related to screening for STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, hepatitis B, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis. These recommendations can be found at <a href="/web/20180713022457/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48875&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2f" title="USPSTF Web site">www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information about STI prevention, testing, and resources at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180713022457/http://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm" target="_blank" title="CDC Web site">www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. It recommends that health care providers inform patients on how to reduce their risk for STI transmission, including abstinence, correct and consistent condom use, and limiting the number of sex partners. The CDC also maintains an inventory of efficacious interventions in the "Compendium of Evidence-Based HIV Behavioral Interventions" (available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180713022457/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/compendium" target="_blank" title="CDC Web site">www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/compendium</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>).</p>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force has issued several recommendations on the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), other STIs, and teen pregnancy. The Community Guide discusses interventions that have been effective in school settings and for MSM (available at <a href="/web/20180713022457/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48875&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thecommunityguide.org%2fhiv%2findex.html" title="Community Preventive Services Task Force Web site">www.thecommunityguide.org/hiv/index.html</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>).</p>
<p>The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has issued recommendations on the control of vaccine-preventable diseases, including hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180713022457/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html" target="_blank" title="CDC Web site">www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>).</p>
<p>The National Coalition of Sexually Transmitted Disease Directors and the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors developed optimal care checklists for health providers of MSM (available at <a href="/web/20180713022457/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48875&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ncsddc.org%2fpublications%2foptimal-care-checklists-providers-msm-patients" title="NCSDDC Web site">www.ncsddc.org/publications/optimal-care-checklists-providers-msm-patients</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>).</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force defines <em>certainty</em> as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p><strong>Data Sources and Searches</strong></p>
<p>To identify the cumulative body of literature, the reviewers examined all studies included in the previous USPSTF review and searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL from 1 January 2007 through 4 November 2013 to identify relevant articles published since the previous review. They also searched the bibliographies of relevant reviews and Web sites of governmental agencies and professional organizations, and also consulted with outside experts. Between 4 November 2013 and this publication, they actively monitored published literature for potentially important new trials directly relevant to the key questions in this systematic review; none were located.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and relevant full-text articles against prespecified inclusion criteria. They included trials evaluating counseling interventions targeting risky sexual behaviors to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in adults and adolescents. They excluded studies limited to persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (or populations with very high prevalence of HIV [&gt;10% in the study sample]), inmates and parolees, and persons in inpatient or residential settings because results limited to these groups may not be applicable to general primary care populations.</p>
<p>The investigators required that included interventions be conducted in, or participants be recruited from, primary care or other outpatient clinical settings, including reproductive health clinics, STI clinics, and mental health clinics. They included English-language trials conducted in "very high" human development countries according to the World Health Organization. They accepted the following comparators as control groups: usual care, attention control, minimal intervention (&lt;15 minutes of intervention contact), wait list, or no intervention. They included trials reporting 1 or more of the following at 3 months after baseline or later: patient health outcomes (STI incidence and morbidity or mortality related to STIs), sexual behavioral outcomes (for example, condom use or number of sexual partners), and harms of the intervention (for example, care avoidance).</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently assessed the methodological quality of each study using USPSTF criteria. Studies were rated as good, fair, or poor quality. Good quality studies had adequate randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, reliable outcome measures (for example, at least standard laboratory procedures or efforts to minimize demand characteristics for self-reported outcomes), similar groups at baseline and follow-up, low attrition, acceptable statistical methods, and adequate adherence to the intervention. Fair quality trials met some but not all of these criteria. Poor quality studies had a serious flaw (for example, attrition &gt;40%, differential attrition &gt;20% between groups, or substantial baseline differences between groups) or multiple important limitations that would invalidate the study findings.&nbsp;They excluded all poor-quality studies. They resolved disagreements through discussion and, if necessary, consultation with a third investigator. One investigator abstracted data from all included studies into a standard evidence table. A second investigator checked the data for accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The investigators created summary tables for each key question that included trial characteristics and summaries of results and qualitatively examined the range of results and potential associations with effect size. They stratified their analyses on the basis of age (adolescents vs. adults, including age-based subgroup analyses when reported) and estimated intervention intensity: high (&gt;2 hours of intervention contact), moderate (0.5 to 2 hours of intervention contact), and low (brief single session or &lt;0.5 hour of intervention contact). These cut points were selected to correspond with a typical, single brief session that would be feasible in a primary care office (low intensity); a longer single session or 2 to 3 brief sessions that may be feasible in selected primary care settings (medium intensity); and what would probably require multiple nonbrief sessions, usually requiring specialized and trained staff that could be referred from primary care (high intensity). They categorized populations on the basis of sexually transmitted infection (STI) "risk." "Low/mix" referred to a mix of sexually active and pre&ndash;sexually active participants (for adolescents only). "General" referred to sexually active adults with no further risk factors and not in a setting with increased risk (for adults only). "Increased" referred to participants with increased risk based on sociodemographics (sexually active teenagers, low-income inner-city residents, racial/ethnic subgroup with higher STI prevalence, men who have sex with men [MSM], and mentally ill or disabled persons), sexual history (for example, persons reporting high-risk behaviors), or setting (for example, STI clinics). The "prior STI" category was limited to persons with a current or recent STI at baseline. Additional potential moderators or mediators that were examined in exploratory qualitative analysis include characteristics of the interventions (degree of cultural tailoring, group vs. individual format, condom negotiation or other communication training as an intervention component, counselor characteristics, setting, type of control group, or number of sessions) and population (sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, mental health issues, or history of abuse).</p>
<p>The investigators did random-effects meta-analyses for STI incidence using the DerSimonian&ndash;Laird method. They analyzed odds ratios because they were the most commonly reported outcome, which allowed including the largest number of studies in the meta-analysis. They ran sensitivity analyses using the profile likelihood method because some of our pooled estimates were derived from a small number of trials. Results were very similar, and all statistically significant results remained statistically significant with the profile likelihood method. Results shown on forest plots are from the DerSimonian&ndash;Laird analyses. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic. They used Stata, version 11.2 (StataCorp), for all meta-analyses.</p></div></p>

<p>*<em>A, B, C, D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the USPSTF constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term certainty will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force defines <em>certainty</em> as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span>. Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send a draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document.&nbsp;The evidence review is also posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site for 4 weeks. After assembling these external review and public comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response to Public Comment</span>. A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 29 April to 26 May 2014. In response to public comments, the USPSTF clarified that the recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and to adults who are at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The USPSTF further clarified that persons diagnosed with an STI should be considered at increased risk for subsequent STIs. The revised recommendation provides more information about treatment factors other than intensity and expanded discussion of the limitations of the available evidence. In addition, the USPSTF offered more guidance for providers on implementation of this recommendation. The USPSTF also noted the need for more information from trials in both sexes and other broad-based interventions that could be implemented in or linked to primary care, as well as interventions to reduce risk for STIs in older Americans.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</span>. Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p></div></p>

<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found adequate evidence that intensive behavioral counseling interventions reduce the likelihood of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in sexually active adolescents and in adults who are at increased risk. The USPSTF determined that this benefit is of moderate magnitude.

    <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specific preventive care services for patients without related signs or symptoms. </li>
    <li>It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the benefits and harms of the service and an assessment of the balance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a service in this assessment. </li>
    <li>The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence but individualize decision making to the specific patient or situation. Similarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and coverage decisions involve considerations in addition to the evidence of clinical benefits and harms. </li>
    <li>Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="/web/20180713022457/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48875&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713022457im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div></p>
