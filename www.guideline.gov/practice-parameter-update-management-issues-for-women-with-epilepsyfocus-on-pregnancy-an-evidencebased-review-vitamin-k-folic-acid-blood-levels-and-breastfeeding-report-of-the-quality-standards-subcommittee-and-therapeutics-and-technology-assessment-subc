<p><strong>Does preconceptional folic acid supplementation reduce the risk of birth defects in neonates of women with epilepsy (WWE) taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) in the offspring of women with epilepsy (WWE) is possibly decreased by folic acid supplementation (two adequately sensitive Class III studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Preconceptional folic acid supplementation in WWE may be considered to reduce the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the risk of hemorrhagic disease in neonates born to WWE taking AEDs?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to determine if the risk of neonatal hemorrhagic complications in the newborns of WWE taking AEDs is substantially increased (one inadequately sensitive Class II study). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Counseling of WWE who are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy should reflect that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications in the newborns of WWE taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does prenatal vitamin K supplementation reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications in the newborns of WWE taking AEDs?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence is inadequate to determine if prenatal vitamin K supplementation in WWE reduces neonatal hemorrhagic complications. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of prenatal vitamin K supplementation for reducing the risk of hemorrhagic complications in the newborns of WWE (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do maternally ingested AEDs cross the placenta? Do maternally ingested AEDs penetrate into breast milk?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions (Placental Transfer)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Phenobarbital (PB), primidone (PRM), phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), levetiracetam (LVT), and valproate (VPA) probably cross the placenta in potentially clinically important amounts (one Class I and supporting Class II studies or two or more Class II studies). </li>
    <li>Gabapentin (GBP), lamotrigine (LTG), oxcarbazepine (OXC), and topiramate (TPM) possibly cross the placenta in potentially clinically important amounts (at least one Class II study for each). </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to determine if ethosuximide (ESM) crosses the placenta in clinically important amounts (one Class III study showing significant penetration). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation (Placental Transfer)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The fact that PB, PRM, PHT, CBZ, LVT, VPA, GBP, LTG, OXC, and TPM cross the placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED treatment for a woman with epilepsy (<strong>Level B</strong> for PB, PRM, PHT, CBZ, LVT, and VPA, and <strong>Level C</strong> for GBP, LTG, OXC, and TPM). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Conclusions (Breast Milk Penetration)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>PRM and LVT probably penetrate into breast milk in potentially clinically important amounts (one Class I study and a supporting Class II study or two Class II studies). </li>
    <li>GBP, LTG, and TPM possibly penetrate into breast milk in potentially clinically important amounts (one Class II study each). </li>
    <li>VPA, PB, PHT, and CBZ probably do not penetrate into breast milk in potentially clinically important amounts (one Class I study and a supporting Class II study or two Class II studies). </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to determine if ESM penetrates into breast milk in clinically important amounts (one Class III study showing significant transfer). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation (Breast Milk Penetration)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>VPA, PB, PHT, and CBZ may be considered as not transferring into breast milk to as great an extent as PRM, LVT, GBP, LTG, and TPM (<strong>Level B</strong> when compared to PRM and LVT and <strong>Level C</strong> when compared to GBP, LTG, and TPM). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does indirect exposure to maternally ingested AEDs lead to symptomatic effects in the newborn?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no evidence to determine if indirect exposure to maternally ingested AEDs has symptomatic effects on the newborns of WWE. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>None (<strong>Level U</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For each of the AEDs, does pregnancy cause a change in the levels of the medication or clearance of the medication?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pregnancy probably causes an increase in the clearance and a decrease in the level of LTG during pregnancy. The decrease in LTG level is associated with an increase in seizure frequency (one Class I and two Class II studies) </li>
    <li>Pregnancy probably causes a small decrease in concentration of CBZ (9% in second trimester and 12% in third trimester) (one Class I study). </li>
    <li>Pregnancy probably causes an increase in the clearance and a decrease in the level of PHT during pregnancy (one Class I study). </li>
    <li>Pregnancy possibly causes a decrease in the level of the active OXC metabolite, monohydroxy derivative (MHD) (two Class III studies). </li>
    <li>Pregnancy possibly causes a decrease in the level of LVT (one Class II study). </li>
    <li>Evidence for a change in clearance or level of PB, VPA, PRM, and ESM during pregnancy is inadequate to reach a conclusion. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Monitoring of LTG, CBZ, and PHT levels during pregnancy should be considered (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Monitoring of LVT and OXC (as MHD) levels during pregnancy may be considered (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in PB, VPA, PRM, or ESM levels related to pregnancy (<strong>Level U</strong>), and this lack of evidence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of practice recommendations is linked directly to the level of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Rating of a Prognostic Article</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report. </p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Studies of Therapeutic Intervention</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For non-inferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. </p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.** </p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2009 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, MEDLINE-In-Process, Current Contents, Biologic Abstracts, and BIOSIS previews for relevant articles published between 1985 and December 2005. An updated search was performed from December 2005 through June 2007, with manual searches on some topics through February 2008. The arbitrary cutoff date of 1985 was chosen because these relatively recent articles were thought to reflect current practice and antiepileptic drug (AED) usage patterns and therefore be more applicable and reliable for this assessment than earlier reports. The search terms used were seizures/epilepsy, catamenial epilepsy, pregnancy, anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, teratogenesis, birth defects, pregnancy registry, cognitive outcome, vitamin K, folate/folic acid, breastfeeding, oral contraceptives, polycystic ovary syndrome, hormone replacement therapy, menopause, perimenopause, and fertility. The search was confined to articles using human subjects and included all languages for which there was an abstract in English. A secondary search for missed references was done by reviewing the bibliographies of review articles and meta-analyses identified in the primary search. </p>
<p>The literature search yielded a total of 876 abstracts. To find relevant articles, two panel members screened each of the abstracts. If either panel member thought the article was potentially relevant, the full text was obtained for review. In general, abstracts were excluded from further analysis if they related to eclampsia rather than seizures due to epilepsy, related to basic mechanisms such as teratogenesis or placental AED metabolism, or were unrelated to the questions posed by the panel.</p>
<p>From the abstracts, a total of 285 were selected for complete review. Four panel members reviewed the full text of the articles and identified those that were relevant to each clinical question. Seventy-one relevant articles were identified by the literature search.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched Medline, EMBASE, and Current Contents for studies published between 2009 and 2013 using the following search terms: epilepsy, seizure, women with epilepsy, pregnancy complications, seizure frequency, Vitamin K, folic acid, and breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched Medline for studies published between January 2013 to April 2016, using the following search strategy: ((((((((breast feeding) OR lactation) OR nurse)) OR #9) OR Abnormalities, Drug-Induced)) AND Anticonvulsants) AND ((pregnancy) AND (((seizures) OR catamenial epilepsy) OR epilepsy)), Vitamin K, folic acid, and breastfeeding. Inclusion criteria were RCTs, humans only, relevant to clinical questions; exclusion criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2009 published guideline.</p></div></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Classification and Measures of Effect</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles were classified according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) classification of evidence schemes for prognostic articles and therapeutic intervention studies (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analysis of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Does preconceptional folic acid supplementation reduce the risk of birth defects in neonates of WWE taking AEDs?</em> To be included in the analysis, articles had to measure the association between preconceptional folic acid use and the outcome of major congenital malformations (MCMs).</p>
<p><em>What is the risk of hemorrhagic disease in neonates born to WWE taking AEDs?</em> To be included in the analysis, studies had to compare the risk of neonatal hemorrhagic complications in newborns of WWE taking AEDs to newborns of women without epilepsy.</p>
<p><em>Do maternally ingested AEDs cross the placenta? Do maternally ingested AEDs penetrate into breast milk?</em> Articles were included if the investigators measured AED levels in at least five mother-child pairs for evaluation of placental transfer and a minimum of five maternal serum-breast milk pairs.</p>
<p><em>For each of the AEDs, does pregnancy cause a change in the levels of the medication or clearance of the medication?</em> Articles were included in the analysis if the investigators compared preconception and postpartum AED levels.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2009 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) assembled a panel of experts including epileptologists, general neurologists, and doctors in pharmacy with expertise in antiepileptic drugs. Panel members with expertise in obstetrics, obstetrical nursing, and teratology were also included. </p>
<p>The Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society developed a set of clinical questions relevant to the evaluation of management issues related to the care of women with epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The strength of the practice recommendations was directly linked to the class of evidence using the scheme described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAN assesses their clinical practice guidelines every 2 years to determine whether new literature has been published that would warrant an update. The following steps are taken:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Biennial correspondence is sent to all authors and the facilitator. </li>
    <li>An updated literature search and a review of methodological soundness are performed by a Guideline Development Subcommittee (GDS) member. (Note: The search should specifically seek to identify new evidence that would change the conclusions in the systematic review or recommendations in the CPG.) </li>
</ul>
<p>All documents biennially reviewed by the GDS that don't require an update are reaffirmed. See the AAN <a href="/web/20180712213723/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=14679&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2ftools.aan.com%2fglobals%2faxon%2fassets%2f9023.pdf" title="AAN Web site">Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712213723im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> for additional information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) Subcommittee member who had expertise in epilepsy conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists. </p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The strength of practice recommendations is linked directly to the level of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div></p>

Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendation of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.
