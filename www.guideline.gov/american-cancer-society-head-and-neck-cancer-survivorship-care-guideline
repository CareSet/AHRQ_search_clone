                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature review began with an environmental scan of existing guidelines and guidance developed by other organizations (e.g., the National Comprehensive Cancer Network<sup>&reg;</sup> [NCCN<sup>&reg;</sup>], ASCO), specific medical centers (e.g., The University of Texas MD Anderson Clinical Tools and Resources Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship algorithm, US Preventive Services Task Force), and those available from other countries (e.g., Australian Cancer Survivorship Centre).</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed for 2004 through April 2015. Studies on childhood cancers, qualitative studies, and non-English publications were excluded. Also excluded were studies that consisted of entirely non-North American populations, because head and neck cancer (HNC) prevalence is higher in some countries due to lifestyle causes and differing etiology. Search terms included: cancer survivor AND review OR meta-analysis OR systematic review OR guidelines; guidance AND head and neck cancer OR head and neck cancer survivor; head and neck cancer patient post-treatment AND symptom management OR late effects OR long-term effects OR psychosocial care OR palliative care OR health promotion OR surveillance OR screening for new cancers OR self-management OR guidelines OR guidance OR follow up OR follow-up OR side effects OR (chemotherapy AND side effects) OR (radiation AND side effects), OR surgery OR treatment complications OR genetic counseling and testing OR survivor or patient interventions OR provider interventions OR provider education OR barriers. Additional search attempts included head and neck cancer OR head and neck cancer survivor OR head and neck cancer patient post-treatment AND (symptom-specific terms, such as swallowing, body image, neck dissection, etc.).</p>
<p>The highest priority was given to articles that met the following criteria: peer-reviewed publication in English since 2004 unless a seminal article published before that date still carried the most weight, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and population-based case-control studies; studies of more than 50 cancer cases analyzed and with high-quality assessment of covariates and analytic methods; and analyses controlled for important confounders (e.g., preexisting comorbid conditions).</p></div></p>

<p>The guideline summarizes literature with the highest level of evidence. A comprehensive list of evidence is available in the Supporting Information Table (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Methods used to develop this guideline were influenced by the American Cancer Society (ACS) cancer screening and survivorship care guidelines. Where appropriate, this guideline builds upon the recently published American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) symptom-based guidelines for adult cancer survivors. ASCO has symptom-based guidelines specific to fatigue, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Formation</span></strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was formed and tasked with drafting the ACS Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. Workgroup members had expertise in primary care, dentistry, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, clinical psychology, speech language pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and nursing. In addition, a head and neck cancer (HNC) cancer survivor was included to provide a patient perspective.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Clinical interpretation of the included evidence follows each recommendation, along with a rating of the level of evidence (LOE) supporting each recommendation. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature, but most evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong, evidence-based recommendation. Rather, recommendations should be largely viewed as possible management strategies given the current evidence base and the logistical challenges of comprehensively adhering to these recommendations.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Disclaimer</span></strong></p>
<p>The clinical practice guideline published herein is provided by the American Cancer Society (ACS) to assist providers in clinical decision making. This information should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.</p>
<p>This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. The ACS provides this information on an "as is" basis and makes no warranty, express or suggested, regarding the information. The ACS specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. The ACS assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>A significant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence base to provide clear and specific recommendations for the prevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer survivors. There are few prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing interventions among head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. The majority of the citations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects and management recommendations rely predominantly on case-control studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that combine studies with various outcome measures. There were several cohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of late effects.</p>
