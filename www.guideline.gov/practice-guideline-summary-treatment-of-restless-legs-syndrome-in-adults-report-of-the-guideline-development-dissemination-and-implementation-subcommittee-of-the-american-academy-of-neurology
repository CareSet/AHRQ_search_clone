<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome (RLS), clinicians should consider prescribing a pharmacologic agent to reduce RLS symptoms. There is strong evidence to support the use of pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and gabapentin enacarbil (<strong>Level A</strong>); moderate evidence to support the use of ropinirole, pregabalin, and intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) (<strong>Level B</strong>); and weak evidence to support the use of levodopa (<strong>Level C</strong>). There are few head-to-head comparisons of these agents to suggest that one should be used preferentially, though in practice clinicians often decide on the basis of comorbidities or potential side effects such as augmentation with dopaminergic agents. When considering efficacy alone, clinicians may consider choosing cabergoline instead of levodopa (<strong>Level C</strong>). However, cabergoline is rarely used in clinical practice for RLS because of a risk of cardiac valvulopathy at higher doses. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the preferential use of pregabalin instead of pramipexole (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>For patients with primary RLS for whom clinicians want to target sleep, clinicians should consider prescribing a pharmacologic agent that improves objective or subjective sleep parameters (or both). Evidence supports agents to different extents for subjective and objective outcomes.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>When targeting periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), specifically the Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI) as measured by polysomnography (PSG), there is strong evidence to support the use of ropinirole (<strong>Level A</strong>); moderate evidence to support the use of pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and pregabalin (<strong>Level B</strong>); and weak evidence to support the use of levodopa (<strong>Level C</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of gabapentin enacarbil, FCM, or iron sucrose for PLMS (<strong>Level U</strong>). There is weak evidence (<strong>Level C</strong>) for using pramipexole in preference to pregabalin with regard to PLMI alone. </li>
        <li>With regard to other objective sleep measures (e.g., total sleep time [TST], sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset [WASO]), there is moderate evidence to support the use of ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin for at least some objective sleep measures (<strong>Level B</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, or levodopa for these measures (<strong>Level U</strong>). There is weak evidence (<strong>Level C</strong>) for using pregabalin in preference to pramipexole with regard to objective sleep measures other than PLMI. </li>
        <li>With regard to subjective sleep measures, there is strong evidence to support the use of cabergoline and gabapentin enacarbil (<strong>Level A</strong>); moderate evidence to support the use of ropinirole, pramipexole, and pregabalin (<strong>Level B</strong>); weak to moderate evidence to support the use of rotigotine (<strong>Levels B and C</strong>); and weak evidence to support the use of levodopa (<strong>Level C</strong>), with the strength of evidence varying by measure and, sometimes, dose. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of FCM for subjective sleep measures (<strong>Level U</strong>). There is moderate evidence to support the use of pregabalin instead of pramipexole with regard to subjective sleep outcomes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For patients with RLS for whom clinicians want to target concomitant psychiatric symptoms, clinicians should consider ropinirole in the context of anxiety (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may consider ropinirole in the context of depression (<strong>Level C</strong>). In the context of moderate to severe RLS-related mood disturbance, clinicians may consider prescribing pramipexole for depression and anxiety (<strong>Level C</strong>). For overall mood, clinicians should consider prescribing gabapentin enacarbil (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For patients with RLS for whom clinicians want to select an agent that improves quality of life (QoL), clinicians should consider prescribing ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline, gabapentin enacarbil, or IV FCM (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may consider prescribing rotigotine or pregabalin (<strong>Level C</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of levodopa for improving QoL in RLS (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>When avoidance of augmentation is a deciding factor, clinicians may consider prescribing pregabalin rather than pramipexole when considering 52-week treatment in light of lower augmentation rates with pregabalin (<strong>Level C</strong>). Clinicians may also consider prescribing cabergoline rather than levodopa when considering 30-week treatment in light of lower augmentation rates with cabergoline (<strong>Level C</strong>); however, this needs to be weighed against the risk of cardiac valvulopathy with high doses of cabergoline. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute which dopaminergic agents cause the least augmentation because augmentation rates are most commonly reported in long-term open-label Class IV studies (<strong>Level U</strong>). Results of these studies are summarized in the full guideline at Neurology.org but cannot support formal recommendations. </li>
    <li>For patients with RLS who have not responded to other treatments, clinicians may consider prescribing prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone (where available) for RLS symptoms, subjective sleep symptoms, and QoL (<strong>Level C</strong>), but potential benefits need to be weighed against known opioid risks. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of gabapentin, iron sucrose, oxycodone, clonazepam, bupropion, clonidine, selenium, rifaximin, botulinum neurotoxin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, or valerian in the treatment of RLS (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>For patients or clinicians wanting to use nonpharmacologic approaches to treat RLS, clinicians should consider prescribing pneumatic compression before usual symptom onset (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may consider prescribing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (where available) (<strong>Level C</strong>). Clinicians may consider prescribing vibrating pads for subjective sleep concerns (<strong>Level C</strong>) but not for RLS symptoms (<strong>Level C against</strong>). Clinicians may also choose not to consider transcranial direct current stimulation for RLS symptoms (<strong>Level C against</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute use of acupuncture in RLS (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with RLS and serum ferritin &le;75 &micro;g/L, clinicians should consider prescribing ferrous sulfate 325 mg with vitamin C 200 mg for improvement of RLS symptoms (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with secondary RLS associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), clinicians should consider prescribing vitamin C and E supplementation (alone or in combination) (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may consider prescribing ropinirole, levodopa, or exercise (<strong>Level C</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of gabapentin or IV iron dextran in RLS associated with ESRD/HD (<strong>Level U</strong>). There is also insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of gabapentin or levodopa preferentially over the other in this population (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>

Three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index) were searched from 1966 to December 2007. The guideline panel subsequently performed an identical search in order to include articles published from December 2007 to August 2011. The independent librarian performed a final identical search in July 2015. The chair of the panel reviewed each of the retrieved 2,729 abstracts to establish whether an article met the basic inclusion criteria: (1) original article described treatment of RLS, (2) study lasted longer than a single night (for each treatment arm), and (3) article was not a single-patient case report.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Articles meeting basic criteria were reviewed and classified by 2 panel members, working independently of each other, for quality of evidence on the basis of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) therapeutic classification scheme rating risk of bias pertaining to study characteristics (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Two additional committee members adjudicated discrepancies between reviewers. Studies involving only interventions that have been withdrawn from the market (e.g., pergolide, which was removed from the market in the United States in 2007 because of concerns regarding associated valvulopathy) were excluded. Recommendations were derived from the conclusions and are strictly tied to the evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>For each intervention, data were extracted for results regarding efficacy for restless leg syndrome (RLS) symptoms and efficacy for sleep, mood, and quality of life (QoL). For RLS efficacy, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group rating scale (IRLS) was the preferred outcome, if available, and a change of 3 points was considered clinically meaningful. For sleep outcomes, the most commonly used subjective scales were the RLS-6 and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, for which clinically meaningful changes have not been established. The MOS Sleep Scale includes 4 subscales: sleep disturbance (decrease indicates improvement), sleep quantity (in hours; increase indicates improvement), sleep adequacy (increase indicates improvement), and daytime somnolence (decrease indicates improvement). For studies reporting Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSG) results, the panel chose to evaluate the Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI), total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) for uniformity between studies. PLMI is a PSG measure calculated by dividing the total number of PLMS by sleep time in hours. The clinical importance of PLMI is uncertain, however, and optimal PSG parameters for assessing clinically meaningful changes in sleep in RLS have not been established.</p>
<p>Even in the face of uncertainty regarding the clinical importance of any given change score on sleep and QoL measures, when considering these outcomes, one must assess not only statistical significance but also clinical relevance in order to decide whether a given result should inform a conclusion for or against use of an agent for that outcome or whether the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions. Statistical significance, clinical significance, and precision were all considered when deriving conclusions from the evidence. This resulted in 6 possible outcomes, 4 occurring in the context of statistical significance and 2 occurring when there is not statistical significance:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The point estimate of the difference between 2 interventions is clinically important, and the confidence interval (CI) around this point estimate is both statistically significant and clinically important: conclusion developed in favor of the superior intervention. </li>
    <li>The point estimate of the difference between 2 interventions is clinically important, and the CI is statistically significant but include values that are not clinically important or are of uncertain clinical relevance: conclusion developed in favor of the superior intervention, but text includes a description of the limitation in interpretation due to CIs. </li>
    <li>The point estimate of the difference between 2 interventions is <em>not</em> clinically important, but the difference is statistically significant and the CI includes a clinically important difference: conclusion states insufficient evidence because the point estimate is not clinically important (regardless of statistical significance), but CIs include a difference that is clinically important, so clinical importance remains possible. </li>
    <li>The point estimate of the difference between 2 interventions is <em>not</em> clinically important, the difference is statistically significant, and the CI includes only values that also are not clinically important: conclusion states that the 2 interventions are essentially equivalent because the difference between them is not clinically important; if one of the interventions is placebo, conclude that the active intervention does not result in a clinically meaningful improvement. </li>
    <li>The difference between 2 interventions is <em>not</em> statistically significant, and the CI does <em>not</em> include clinically important values: conclusion states that the active intervention does not result in benefit vs the comparator. </li>
    <li>The difference between 2 interventions is <em>not</em> statistically significant, but the CI includes clinically important (or potentially clinically important) values: conclude that there is insufficient evidence because, although the results were not statistically significant, there remains the possibility for an important difference between interventions (this is often the case when studies have insufficient precision [e.g., because they are underpowered]). </li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of the IRLS, where a 3-point difference was considered clinically meaningful/relevant, these judgments were made by guideline panel members on the basis of a subjective assessment of the change (e.g., a difference of 30 minutes of night sleep was considered to be potentially clinically important; an odds ratio [OR] CI including 1.01 was perceived to include an OR of dubious clinical importance). Provided or calculated CIs are available for most referenced articles (where data are sufficient to calculate CIs if they were not provided) so that readers can assess whether their judgments align with those made by the guideline panel. The practice guideline indicates when the CIs include values of potential or uncertain clinical relevance. The six categories just presented are most relevant when considering the IRLS, where a clinically important difference was prespecified. In the case of sleep and QoL outcomes, assessment of CIs was most relevant in cautioning against overinterpretation of conclusions in favor of an agent (item 2 in the previous list) or when attempting to decide whether a result that was not statistically significant had a narrow enough CI to recommend against use or whether there was insufficient evidence (items 5 and 6 in the list). Ultimately, readers can derive their own conclusions from review of the provided CIs.</p>
<p>Evidence-based medicine methodology consultants performed random-effects meta-analyses when there was a need to reconcile potentially discordant results or improve statistical precision. For the purpose of establishing confidence in the evidence, results of meta-analyses were considered equivalent to the classification of the contributing studies. For example, if a meta-analysis was performed on 2 Class I studies but only one of those studies had statistical significance, the results of that meta-analysis were considered equivalent to a single Class I study. If a meta-analysis was performed on Class I and Class II studies and none of the studies achieved statistical significance on their own, the results of that meta-analysis were deemed equivalent to a single Class II study.</p>
<p>Results are presented for each dose according to the results extracted from reviewed studies. For the formulation of conclusions, the decision was made to write conclusions for the medication rather than considering each dose separately. This decision was based on the assumption that clinicians will follow prescribing instructions, which typically start at the smallest recommended dose and gradually titrate up to clinical effect, using the lowest effective dose to try to limit dose-dependent side effects. U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved doses for each recommended medication are included in table e-1 of the online Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This practice guideline follows the methodologies outlined in the 2004 edition of the American Academy of Neurology's (AAN's) guideline development process manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). In 2007, the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee (GDDI) of the AAN assembled a panel of clinicians and investigators from the United States and Europe who had published extensively on restless legs syndrome (RLS) and who represented a broad range of relevant expertise and opinion.</p>
<p>Recommendations were based on conclusions and class of evidence in accordance with the AAN process (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field), where Level A reflects strong evidence, Level B reflects moderate evidence, and Level C reflects weak evidence. A Level U recommendation represents insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any given intervention. Class I and II articles are described in the text of the original guideline document (in cases with substantial Class I evidence, Class II evidence is referenced but not described); Class III studies are described only if there are insufficient articles with a higher classification to drive conclusions and recommendations. Class IV studies are not described except in the context of side effects and long-term complications, particularly augmentation.</p></div></p>

<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Benefits</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Reduction in restless legs syndrome (RLS)-related symptoms </li>
    <li>Improvement in sleep parameters </li>
    <li>It is possible that ropinirole improves depression and likely that it improves anxiety at 12 weeks. It is possible that pramipexole improves depression and anxiety at 12 weeks in patients with moderate to severe RLS-related mood disturbance. It is likely that gabapentin enacarbil improves overall mood. </li>
    <li>Refer to the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for discussions of each intervention regarding efficacy for RLS symptoms and efficacy for sleep, mood, and quality of life. </li>
</ul></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Augmentation is a major side effect of long-term treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) with dopaminergic medication (levodopa and dopamine agonists). Augmentation refers to an iatrogenic worsening of RLS and is most commonly characterized by an advance of symptom onset by at least 2 to 4 hours. It may also be manifested by increased intensity of RLS symptoms, wider anatomical distribution, shorter latency to symptom onset, or shorter duration of medication benefit. Its likelihood of occurrence increases with longer duration of dopaminergic medication use; it does not usually occur before 6 months of treatment. </li>
    <li>In addition to the risk of augmentation for dopaminergic agent, it is now recognized that some agents for RLS have less common but important risks. These risks include not only cardiac valvulopathy with cabergoline but also side effects such as impulse control disorders with the dopamine agonists. The augmentation risk and other common or important adverse events of interventions considered in the guideline are summarized in a table in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>Another potential limitation of long-term pharmacologic treatment of RLS is loss of efficacy. </li>
    <li>Benefits of opioid use must be weighed against risks such as potential abuse. </li>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. The AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.</p>
