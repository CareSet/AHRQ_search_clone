                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The systematic review report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) follows the guidance of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses statement and other methodological recommendations from the Cochrane Screening and Diagnostic Tests Methods Group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection Criteria for the Studies in the Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Type of Studies</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included cross-sectional and cohort diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the investigators assessed the effectiveness or accuracy of adjuncts. They excluded study designs such as case-control studies, case reports, case series, abstracts, and uncontrolled reports.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Participants and Target Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Studies eligible for inclusion involved adult patients (aged 18 years or older), ideally in the context of primary care settings, seeking care with or without clinically evident lesions in the oral cavity, encompassing the labial mucosae, buccal mucosae, gingival or alveolar ridge mucosae, tongue, floor of mouth, hard and soft palate, and retromolar trigone. If clinically evident, lesions could manifest as seemingly innocuous or nonsuspicious, suspicious, or seemingly malignant. The reviewers excluded studies involving patients seeking care for cancers of the lips, oropharynx, and salivary glands.</p>
<p><strong>Index Tests and the Criterion Standard</strong></p>
<p>Definitive diagnosis of potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) requires using a criterion standard wherein the patient undergoes a biopsy of the lesion followed by a histopathologic assessment. Studies not specifying any criterion standard were ineligible for inclusion in this systematic review. Other tests, devices, techniques, or technologies intended to facilitate clinical decision making are index tests. The aforementioned adjuncts act as index tests in the context of this review and are used as triage tools in practice. Adjuncts can have either a positive (with suspicion of target condition) or negative (without suspicion of target condition) test result.</p>
<p>The reviewers defined several adjuncts of interest a priori and assessed them regarding their DTA and effectiveness when evaluating patients with:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>No clinically evident lesions in the oral cavity </li>
    <li>Clinically evident seemingly innocuous or nonsuspicious lesions in the oral cavity </li>
    <li>Clinically evident suspicious lesions or seemingly malignant lesions in the oral cavity </li>
</ul>
<p>Adjuncts include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cytologic testing (for example, OralCDx [OralScan Laboratories, Inc.], OralCyte [ClearCyte Diagnostics Inc.], ClearPrep OC [Resolution Biomedical]) </li>
    <li>Autofluorescence (for example, VELscope [LED Dental], OralID [Forward Science]); tissue reflectance (for example, ViziLite Plus [DenMat Holdings, LLC], Microlux DL [AdDent Inc.]) </li>
    <li>Vital staining (for example, toluidine blue) </li>
    <li>Salivary adjuncts (for example, OraRisk [Oral DNA Labs], SaliMark [PeriRx LLC], OraMark [OncAlert Labs], MOP genetic oral cancer screening [PCG Molecular], OraGenomics) </li>
    <li>Additional adjuncts of interest (for example, Identafi [StarDental]) </li>
</ul>
<p>The reviewers also included combinations of aforementioned adjuncts if 1 adjunct informed the use of the second adjunct. They reported results separately if the investigators used 2 index tests in a study independently of each other. They excluded adjuncts not commercially available in the United States at the date of the search.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Outcomes and Estimates</strong></p>
<p>Patient-important outcomes are defined as "outcomes for which&mdash;even if it were the only outcome improved by the intervention&mdash;the patient would still consider receiving the intervention in face of some adverse events, costs, and burden." In the context of adjuncts, patients will prioritize outcomes such as morbidity and mortality and serious adverse events over other surrogate outcomes such as DTA estimates. The reviewers defined the following patient-important outcomes a priori and included all-cause mortality, OSCC mortality, survival, quality of life, unnecessary biopsy, costs, incidence of OSCC, and anxiety and stress. DTA estimates defined a priori included sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. The reviewers used the proportion of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative results to calculate DTA estimates. The reviewers excluded studies when reporting made it impossible to create a contingency table.</p>
<p><strong>Positivity Thresholds</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the <em>Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews</em>, "binary test outcomes are defined on the basis of a threshold for test positivity and change if the threshold is altered." Whenever possible, the reviewers considered all levels of oral epithelial dysplasia (mild, moderate, and severe) assessed during biopsy or histopathologic assessment as positive for the target condition and absence of dysplasia assessed during biopsy or histopathologic assessment as negative for the target condition. For cytologic testing adjuncts, the reviewers grouped any atypical results with dysplastic results when possible and considered them positive for the target condition.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Preexisting Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>As a way to optimize the development of systematic reviews to inform American Dental Association (ADA) guidelines, the reviewers established a collaboration with the Cochrane Oral Health Group. The purpose of this collaboration was to increase efficiency in the use of secondary evidence for the development of clinical practice guidelines by using preexisting high-quality systematic reviews. In the event that no Cochrane reviews were available, they searched for non-Cochrane systematic reviews.</p>
<p>The eligible reviews had to meet 3 criteria. The first was being assessed as having moderate to high methodological quality. The second was being as current as possible. The third was meeting the selection criteria in relation to the type of study design, patient characteristics, index tests, criterion standard, and outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Relevant Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers identified eligible systematic reviews through the collaboration with the Cochrane Oral Health Group. Members of the group suggested Cochrane reviews that potentially met the selection criteria. When no Cochrane reviews were available for a specific clinical question, they searched for non-Cochrane reviews by using the PubMed Clinical Queries tool and prioritized the most current ones (from 2010 to the present). To determine final eligibility, they used the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews tool to assess their methodological quality.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search to Update Existing Reviews and Linked Evidence on Patient-important Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>With the purpose of updating potentially eligible existing reviews, the reviewers searched MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The reviewers included all study designs in the initial search. They also added economic analysis and patients' values and preferences (PVPs). After reviewing the results, they deemed it necessary to rerun the related Cochrane searches. The reviewers rebuilt the Cochrane searches for EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. They then restricted that language to RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses as a means of ensuring the update of the Cochrane review and to inform the patient-important outcomes (linked evidence) of interest. Given that literature related to salivary adjuncts was limited within the bounds of the existing searches, they removed study design considerations to open up the possibilities of finding relevant language. The reviewers restricted the updated Cochrane searches from April 2013 (latest update by Cochrane) to December 2016. They ran the search on economic analysis and PVPs from inception to November 2016. The amended search for salivary adjuncts was run from April 2013 (latest update by Cochrane) to February 2017 (see Appendix 1 of the systematic review). The reviewers did not apply restrictions on language or publication status.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Primary Studies for Update of Systematic Reviews and Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers conducted the study selection process in 3 phases. In the first phase, 2 reviewers independently reassessed eligibility of all included studies in the 2015 and 2013 Cochrane reviews. In the second phase, the same 2 reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts of retrieved references from the updated search strategy for both DTA studies and RCTs. In the third phase, reviewers independently screened the full text of all potentially eligible studies. They resolved any disagreements at full-text level via discussion and consensus. When consensus was elusive, a third reviewer arbitrated and decided final eligibility.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Number of Source Documents</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results of the Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers identified 2 Cochrane reviews in which the investigators reported on diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) for adjuncts in patients both with and without clinically evident lesions developed by the Cochrane Oral Health Group. In addition, they identified 2 non-Cochrane reviews covering the use of salivary adjuncts.</p>
<p>From the 2015 Cochrane review, the reviewers identified 37 studies that were eligible. From the 2013 Cochrane review, no primary studies met the selection criteria. The other 2 non-Cochrane systematic reviews were published in 2016 and 2017 and covered salivary adjuncts for the early diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and no updating process was required.</p>
<p>During the updating process of the evidence from these reviews, the reviewers identified 7,534 references from the electronic databases. After eliminating duplicates, they screened the titles and abstracts of 6,708 citations. They selected 94 potentially eligible articles that were then screened using full texts. Of the 94 full-text articles, they selected 9 studies as part of the updating process and excluded the remaining 85 (eTable 3 in the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). This resulted in a total of 46 included studies (47 reports) (see Figure 1 in the systematic review). No studies on salivary adjuncts met the selection criteria, so they performed a comprehensive search to identify published systematic reviews.</p>
<p>During the process of identifying studies on patients' values and preferences (PVPs), the reviewers identified 2,616 citations and included 59 of those for full-text screening. Finally, 10 studies were eligible. Investigators in none of the studies reported on the relative importance of outcomes in the context of the use of adjuncts for the evaluation of potentially malignant disorders (PMDs).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of the Risk of Bias of Included Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>Similar to methods used in other Cochrane systematic reviews on diagnostic test accuracy (DTA), the reviewers used a modified version of the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS)-2 tool to assess the risk of bias and applicability of primary diagnostic accuracy studies included in the review. Two reviewers used the tool independently and in duplicate. They assessed the following domains in each study: patient selection, index test, criterion standard, and flow and timing. The reviewers assessed all domains in terms of the risk of bias by using signaling questions to assist in the judgments. They also assessed the first 3 domains in terms of their applicability. Other important considerations for the quality assessment included representativeness of the study sample, extent of verification bias, use of blinded methods for interpreting test results, and presence of missing data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers recorded the number of true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative results by using software (Review Manager, Version 5.3, Cochrane Collaboration). They recorded all new events at the lesion level to mirror the data presented in the 2015 Cochrane review. For each study, they displayed estimates of DTA, sensitivity, and specificity, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), in coupled forest plots, as well as plotted in summary receiver operating characteristic curve space according to index test. The reviewers performed meta-analysis to obtain pooled estimates for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for each adjunct by using the bivariate approach (SAS, Version 9.4, SAS Institute). When too few studies were available for pooling by using the bivariate approach, they obtained the pooled estimate by combining their contingency tables for the associated comparison. The reviewers acknowledge that this method may have a tendency to create artificially narrower CIs. However, considering that this review is informing a clinical practice guideline, they prioritized the presentation of pooled estimates to facilitate decision making.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of the Quality of the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers assessed the quality of the evidence for all included outcomes by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with specification for the diagnostic test context. The GRADE approach provides a framework to assess the degree of confidence to place in DTA and patient-important outcomes. In GRADE, crosssectional or cohort studies in patients with diagnostic uncertainty and a comparison with an appropriate criterion standard start as high-quality evidence (high certainty in the evidence). Certainty is reduced, however, when these studies have serious issues such as risk of bias or limitations in study design, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, or high probability of publication bias (see eTable 2 in the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Such issues move the quality of the evidence from high to moderate, low, or very low certainty. The reviewers presented data in summary-of-findings tables created using software (GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool, McMaster University and Evidence Prime). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently and working in duplicate used a standardized form (Excel, Microsoft) to extract the data. They recorded the following data from each study: author's last name and year of publication, country, setting (primary, secondary, or tertiary care), population characteristics (age, sex, selection criteria, and clinical diagnosis of evident lesions), the number of patients included in the study, the number of lesions included in the analysis, index test and criterion standard characteristics, positivity thresholds, source of funding, financial and intellectual conflicts of interest, and diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) and patient-important outcomes. A third reviewer, who acted as arbiter, clarified any discrepancies between extractors. The reviewers made efforts to contact primary study authors whenever deemed necessary.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Configuration</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scientific Affairs nominated and convened the 2017 expert panel for its clinical and subject matter expertise. The panel was configured carefully to include multidisciplinary viewpoints&mdash;general dentists, hygienists, oral medicine specialists, otolaryngologists, oncologists, oral and maxillofacial pathologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and epidemiologists.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moving from the Evidence to Decisions</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence-to-decision framework to inform the process of formulating recommendations and to determine the strength of these statements. They assessed several domains during this process, including patient values and preferences, certainty in the evidence (quality of the evidence), balance between desirable and undesirable consequences (net effect), and resource use. In GRADE, the strength of recommendations can be either strong or conditional. Implications for stakeholders such as patients, clinicians, and policy makers vary between strong and conditional recommendations (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process of Formulating Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel formulated the clinical questions, outcomes of interest, and final recommendations contained in this article during 2 in-person expert panel meetings held in September 2016 and January 2017. Methodologists from the ADA Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry facilitated both meetings. The panel used guidance from the GRADE approach, deliberation, and consensus during implementation of the evidence-to-decision framework. If consensus was elusive, they presented all possible options with assessments for a panel vote.</p></div></p>

<p>The panel contacted internal American Dental Association (ADA) and external stakeholders on 2 occasions: at the beginning of the guideline development process to obtain feedback on the definition of the scope and purpose, target audience and population, clinical questions, adjuncts, and outcomes for decision making and after formulating recommendations to obtain input about the clarity and appropriateness of the recommendation statements and the assessment of the quality of the evidence and strength of the recommendations. In addition, they posted a draft of the guideline's scope and purpose, target audience and users, and recommendation statements on the ADA's Web site with the purpose of obtaining comments from the general public. The panel and methodological team logged and considered these comments and incorporated them when writing this article.</p></div></p>

    <li>For patients with false-negative test results, an appropriate diagnosis would be missed, worsening the prognosis of the disease. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>When applying these recommendations in primary care settings such as dental offices or clinics, one must consider that investigators in much of the existing literature describe the use of adjuncts in secondary and tertiary care settings such as specialty clinics or hospitals. This is an important consideration because investigators have not studied the diagnostic test accuracy of the adjuncts thoroughly in primary care settings, where the prevalence of disease could modify the diagnostic test accuracy of these adjuncts. Another point to consider is that clinicians in secondary and tertiary care settings are advanced in relevant experience and skill and can evaluate and triage lesions more appropriately by using conventional visual and tactile examination (CVTE) alone than can primary care clinicians. Furthermore, referral to a specialist for a biopsy (clinicians with advanced training in oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral and maxillofacial pathology, oral medicine, periodontology, and otolaryngology&ndash;head and neck surgery) is indicated when clinicians are not trained or skilled adequately to perform a biopsy.</p></div></p>

<p>Whenever possible, the panel attempted to avoid involving expert panelists with extensive conflicts of interest. All panel members who initially were invited were asked to complete a form providing information about any potential financial and intellectual conflicts of interest within the past 2 years. For the sake of transparency, they summarized and presented all potential conflicts to the entire panel at the beginning of both in-person meetings. As part of the methodology, they planned that any member of the panel considered to be highly conflicted would need to refrain from participating in the formulation of recommendations for which they identified conflicts.</p>
