<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Guideline Questions</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What biomarkers are useful to select patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for targeted and conventional therapies? </li>
    <li>How should tissue specimens be processed for biomarker testing for CRC management? </li>
    <li>How should biomarker testing for CRC management be performed? </li>
    <li>How should molecular testing of CRC be implemented and operationalized? </li>
    <li>Are there emerging genes/biomarkers that should be routinely tested in CRC? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Statements</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Colorectal carcinoma patients being considered for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy must receive <em>RAS</em> (rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutational testing. Mutational analysis should include <em>KRAS</em> (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and <em>NRAS</em> (neuroblastoma <em>RAS</em> viral [v-ras] oncogene homolog) codons 12, 13 of exon 2; 59, 61 of exon 3; and 117 and 146 of exon 4 ("expanded" or "extended" <em>RAS</em>) (Type: recommendation; Strength of Evidence: convincing/adequate, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of Evidence: high/intermediate). </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li><em>BRAF</em> (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) p.V600 (<em>BRAF</em> c. 1799 [p.V600]) mutational analysis should be performed in colorectal cancer tissue in patients with colorectal carcinoma for prognostic stratification (Type: recommendation; Strength of Evidence: adequate/inadequate, balance of benefits and harms; Quality of Evidence: intermediate/low). </li>
        <li><em>BRAF</em> p.V600 mutational analysis should be performed in deficient mismatch repair (MMR) tumors with loss of MLH1 (MutL homolog 1) to evaluate for Lynch syndrome risk. Presence of a <em>BRAF</em> mutation strongly favors a sporadic pathogenesis. The absence of <em>BRAF</em> mutation does not exclude risk of Lynch syndrome (Type: recommendation; Strength of Evidence: adequate/inadequate, balance of benefits and harms; Quality of Evidence: intermediate/low). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>Clinicians should order mismatch repair status testing in patients with colorectal cancers for the identification of patients at high risk for Lynch syndrome and/or prognostic stratification (Type: recommendation; Strength of Evidence: adequate/inadequate, balance of benefits and harms; Quality of Evidence: intermediate/low). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend <em>BRAF</em> c.1799 p.V600 mutational status as a predictive molecular biomarker for response to anti-EGFR inhibitors (Type: no recommendation; Strength of Evidence: insufficient, benefits/harms balance unknown; Quality of Evidence: insufficient). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend <em>PIK3CA</em> (phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha) mutational analysis of colorectal carcinoma tissue for therapy selection outside of a clinical trial (Type: no recommendation; Strength of Evidence: insufficient, benefits/harms balance unknown; Quality of Evidence: insufficient).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Retrospective studies have suggested improved survival with post-operative aspirin use in patients whose colorectal carcinoma harbors a <em>PIK3CA</em> mutation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) analysis (expression by immunohistochemistry [IHC] or deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) in colorectal carcinoma tissue for patients who are being considered for therapy selection outside of a clinical trial (Type: no recommendation; Strength of Evidence: insufficient, benefits/harms balance unknown; Quality of Evidence: insufficient). </li>
    <li>Metastatic or recurrent colorectal carcinoma tissues are the preferred specimens for treatment predictive biomarker testing and should be used if such specimens are available and adequate. In their absence, primary tumor tissue is an acceptable alternative, and should be used (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue is an acceptable specimen for molecular biomarker mutational testing in colorectal carcinoma. Use of other specimens (e.g., cytology specimens) will require additional adequate validation, as would any changes in tissue processing protocols (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Laboratories must use validated colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing methods with sufficient performance characteristics for the intended clinical use. Colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing validation should follow accepted standards for clinical molecular diagnostics tests (Type: strong recommendation; Strength of Evidence: convincing/adequate, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of Evidence: high/intermediate). </li>
    <li>Performance of molecular biomarker testing for colorectal carcinoma must be validated in accordance with best laboratory practices (Type: strong recommendation; Strength of Evidence: convincing/adequate, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of Evidence: high/intermediate). </li>
    <li>Laboratories must validate the performance of IHC testing for colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarkers (currently IHC testing for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) in accordance with best laboratory practices (Type: strong recommendation; Strength of Evidence: convincing/adequate, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of Evidence: high/intermediate). </li>
    <li>Laboratories must provide clinically appropriate turnaround times and optimal utilization of tissue specimens by using appropriate techniques (e.g., multiplexed assays) for clinically relevant molecular and immunohistochemical biomarkers of colorectal cancer (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Molecular and IHC biomarker testing in colorectal carcinoma should be initiated in a timely fashion based upon the clinical scenario and in accordance with institutionally accepted practices (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Test ordering can occur on a case-by-case basis or by policies established by the medical staff.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Laboratories should establish policies to ensure efficient allocation and utilization of tissue for molecular testing, particularly in small specimens (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Members of the patient's medical team, including pathologists, may initiate colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker test orders in accordance with institutionally accepted practices (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Laboratories that require send out of tests for treatment predictive biomarkers should process and send colorectal carcinoma specimens to reference molecular laboratories in a timely manner (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Pathologists must evaluate candidate specimens for biomarker testing to ensure specimen adequacy taking into account tissue quality, quantity, and malignant tumor cell fraction. Specimen adequacy findings should be documented in the patient report (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Laboratories should use colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing methods that are able to detect mutations in specimens with at least 5% mutant allele frequency, taking into account the analytical sensitivity of the assay (limit of detection or LOD) and tumor enrichment (e.g., microdissection) (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended that the operational minimal neoplastic carcinoma cell content tested should be set at least 2 times the assay's LOD.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker results should be made available as promptly as feasible in order to inform therapeutic decision-making, both prognostic and predictive (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is suggested that a benchmark of 90% of reports available within 10 working days from date of receipt in the molecular diagnostics laboratory.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing reports should include a results and interpretation section readily understandable by oncologists and pathologists. Appropriate Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) and Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) nomenclature must be used in conjunction with any historical genetic designations (Type: expert consensus opinion; Strength of Evidence: inadequate/insufficient, benefits and harms in balance; Quality of Evidence: low). </li>
    <li>Laboratories must incorporate colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing methods into their overall laboratory quality improvement program, establishing appropriate quality improvement monitors as needed to assure consistent performance in all steps of the testing and reporting process. In particular, laboratories performing colorectal carcinoma molecular biomarker testing must participate in formal proficiency testing programs, if available, or an alternative proficiency assurance activity (Type: strong recommendation; Strength of Evidence: convincing/adequate, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of Evidence: high/intermediate). </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search and Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search for literature was performed in MEDLINE using the OvidSP (August 1, 2013) and PubMed (September 17, 2013) interfaces. The initial MEDLINE search encompassed the publication dates of January 1, 2008, through August 1, 2013 (OvidSP), and January 1, 2008, through September 17, 2013 (PubMed). A supplemental literature search was performed using Scopus (September 25, 2013) to identify relevant articles published between January 1, 2008, and September 25, 2013, in journals not indexed in MEDLINE. The literature search of the electronic databases involved two separate searches in each database, the first using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords for the concepts "colorectal cancer," "biomarkers," "treatment," and "treatment outcomes" and the second using terms for the concepts "colorectal cancer," "biomarkers," and "laboratory methods." Limits were set for human studies published in English, and a publication filter was applied to exclude lower levels of evidence such as letters, commentaries, editorials, and case reports. The Ovid search was rerun on February 12, 2015, to identify articles published since August 1, 2013.</p>
<p>In addition to the searches of electronic databases, an Internet search of international health organizations, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Guidelines International Network was conducted for existing relevant guidelines or protocols. Guidelines were included if they were published since 2008 in English. The proceedings of the meetings of American Association of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, European Society for Medical Oncology, and the American Association for Cancer Research from 2012 and 2013 were also searched for relevant abstracts.</p>
<p>A focused examination of all systematic reviews retrieved by the initial literature search and retained after full-text review was performed to identify primary research studies not already included. In addition, recommendations from the Expert Panel were reviewed, and the reference lists of all articles deemed eligible for inclusion were scanned for relevant reports. The results of all searches were combined and deduplicated.</p>
<p>Detailed information regarding the literature search strategy can be found in the supplemental digital content (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Eligible Study Designs</strong></p>
<p>Practice guidelines, consensus documents, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, comparative studies, reviews, and evaluation studies were eligible for inclusion. In addition to journal articles, the search identified meeting abstracts.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>An assessment of the quality of the evidence was performed for all retained studies following application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria by the methodologist. Using this method, studies deemed to be of low quality would not be excluded from the systematic review but would be retained and their methodologic strengths and weaknesses discussed where relevant. Studies would be assessed by confirming the presence of items related to both internal and external validity, which are all associated with methodologic rigor and a decrease in the risk of bias. The quality assessment of the studies was performed by determining the risk of bias by assessing key indicators, based on study design, against known criteria. (Refer to the supplemental digital content [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) for detailed discussion of the quality assessment.)</p>
<p>For strength of the evidence, the panel considered the level of evidence, as well as its quantity and quality of included studies. The level of evidence was based on the study design as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Level I - evidence from systematic reviews or clinical practice guidelines of appropriate level II studies </li>
    <li>Level II - evidence from good-quality, randomized, controlled trials </li>
    <li>Level III - evidence from low-quality comparative studies (e.g., prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies) </li>
    <li>Level IV - evidence from studies without a comparator (e.g., case reports, case series, narrative reviews) </li>
</ul>
<p>In general, level I and II evidence is considered most appropriate to answer clinical questions, but in the absence of such high-quality evidence, the panel considered data from lower quality studies. The quantity of evidence refers to the number of studies and number of cases included for each outcome in the recommendation. The quality of studies reflects how well the studies were designed to eliminate bias and threats to validity.</p>
<p>The appropriateness of the study design and data collected, relevance and clarity of findings, and adequacy of conclusions were evaluated. Each study was assessed individually (refer to the supplemental digital content for individual assessments and results) and then summarized by study type. Components such as generalizability and applicability were also considered when determining the strength of evidence. A summary of the overall quality of the evidence was given considering the evidence in totality. Ultimately, the designation (i.e., rating or grade) of the strength of evidence is a judgment by the Expert Panel of its level of confidence that the evidence from the studies informing the recommendations reflects true effect (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field for the grades for strength of evidence).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center (the Center), the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened an Expert Panel consisting of practicing pathologists, oncologists, geneticists, and a biostatistician with expertise and experience in molecular biomarker testing and targeted therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC). The ASCP, CAP, AMP, and ASCO jointly approved the appointment of the project, co-chairs, and Expert Panel members. In addition, a methodologist experienced in systematic review and guideline development consulted with the panel throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessing the Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Development of recommendations requires that the panel review the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments (using procedures described in the supplemental digital content [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Grades for strength of recommendations were developed by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center and are described in "Rating Scheme of the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>The panel convened 14 times (11 teleconference webinars and three face-to-face meetings) from July 27, 2013, through September 24, 2015, to develop the scope, draft recommendations, review and respond to solicited feedback, and assess the quality of evidence that supports the final recommendations. Additional work was completed via electronic mail. An open comment period was held from March 30, 2015, through April 22, 2015, during which draft recommendations were posted on the AMP Web site. Twenty-one guideline statements had an agreement ranging from 60% to 94% for each statement from the open-comment period participants (refer to Outcomes section in the supplemental digital content [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for full details). </p>
<p>The Web site received a total of 248 comments. Teams of three to four Expert Panel members were assigned three to five draft recommendations to review all comments received and provide an overall summary to the rest of the panel. Following panel discussion and the final quality of evidence assessment, the panel members determined whether to maintain the original draft recommendation as is, revise it with minor language change, or consider it as a major recommendation change. The Expert Panel modified eight draft statements based on the feedback during the open-comment period and the considered judgment process. Resolution of all changes was obtained by majority consensus of the panel using nominal group technique (rounds of email discussion and multiple edited recommendations) among the panel members. The final recommendations were approved by the Expert Panel with a formal vote. The panel considered the risks and benefits throughout the judgment process.</p></div></p>

Mutations in some of the biomarkers have clear prognostic value (<em>BRAF</em> [V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1], MMR [mismatch repair]), and at least two (<em>KRAS</em> [Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog] and <em>NRAS</em> [neuroblastoma <em>RAS</em> (rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog]) have relatively strong evidence as negative predictors of benefit to anti-EGFR therapies and should be used to guide the use of these agents. <em>BRAF</em> mutations are consistently associated with poor outcomes in patients with metastatic CRC, including those who relapse after adjuvant therapy. Patients with localized colon cancer and dMMR (deficient mismatch repair) have improved outcomes. Emerging data indicate that MMR status may have predictive value in some settings, specifically in patients with advanced disease being considered for anti&ndash;programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1)/anti&ndash;programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-L1) therapy.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Proper validation of colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarker testing is important to ensure appropriate patient care. If validation is inadequate, this can lead to erroneous results and improper diagnosis, prognosis, and/or therapeutic intervention. For example, with regard to <em>RAS</em> (rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) testing, a false-positive result would lead to an improper withholding of therapy, whereas a false-negative result would lead to distribution of an ineffective therapy, resulting in increased costs and unnecessary side effects. </li>
    <li>Pathologists evaluating tissue section for biomarker evaluation should also be aware that necrosis and tissue degeneration can lead to erroneous results, and foci demonstrating significant necrosis should be avoided for molecular testing. Any amount of necrosis in the sample selected for biomarker testing should be estimated and documented. </li>
