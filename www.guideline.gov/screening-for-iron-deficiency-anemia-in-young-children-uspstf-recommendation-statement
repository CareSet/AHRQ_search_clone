                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the levels of certainty regarding net benefit (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although the 2006 recommendation included a statement on supplementation in young children, the USPSTF has now determined that given the current widespread use of iron-fortified foods in the United States, including infant formulas and cereals, the impact of making a recommendation on physician-prescribed supplementation is likely limited. For this reason, the USPSTF decided to focus the current recommendation on screening only.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 24 months. (<strong>I statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). It does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Recommendations regarding screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women and iron supplementation during pregnancy are addressed in a separate recommendation statement (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the USPSTF guideline <a href="/web/20180712205328/https://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=49630" title="Guideline #10802" target="_blank">Screening for iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation in pregnant women to improve maternal health and birth outcomes: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statement</strong></p>
<p><em>Potential Preventable Burden</em></p>
<p>Estimates of the prevalence of iron deficiency in children ages 1 to 3 years in the United States range from 8% to 14%, and approximately one-third of these children also have anemia. Based on 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 12 to 35 months is 2.1%. Several factors have been identified that may increase a child's risk for iron deficiency anemia, including prematurity or low birth weight, use of non&ndash;iron-fortified formula or introduction to cow's milk in the first year of life, and exclusive breastfeeding without regular intake of iron-fortified food after age 6 months. Demographic factors associated with increased risk for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status and having parents who are migrant workers or recent immigrants. Additional factors that may be associated with increased risk for iron deficiency in children include weight and height in the 95th percentile or greater, bottle feeding beyond the first year of life, having a mother who is currently pregnant, or living in an urban area. Evidence on whether Hispanic ethnicity increases children's risk for iron deficiency has been mixed, with some studies showing an increased risk and others showing no increased risk. Older data from NHANES (1988&ndash;1994) showed that Mexican American children were nearly 3 times more likely than white children to have iron deficiency, whereas more recent NHANES data from 1999 to 2002 found no increased risk in Hispanic children. The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the performance of risk assessment tools to identify children who are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia.</p>
<p>Some observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia in early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioral delays and poorer performance on cognitive tests. However, concluding that there is a direct causal link between iron deficiency anemia and these outcomes is difficult because of the methodological flaws in these studies and potential confounding due to underlying nutritional and socioeconomic differences between groups. The aim of screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children is to identify and treat anemia before it leads to poor child health outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Potential Harms</em></p>
<p>The harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia have not been well studied. Potential harms of screening include false-positive results, anxiety, and cost. Reported adverse events of treatment with iron include limited gastrointestinal symptoms, darkening color of stool, staining of teeth and gums, and drug interactions with other medications. The previous USPSTF recommendation also noted that accidental iron overdose can occur in children receiving treatment or supplementation with iron.</p>
<p><em>Current Practice</em></p>
<p>No recent nationally representative data on the current rate of screening are available.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>Although the evidence is insufficient to recommend specific tests for screening, measurement of serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is often the first step.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment and Interventions</strong></p>
<p>In the United States, iron deficiency anemia in children is usually treated with oral iron. The usual dose in infants and young children is 3 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses.</p>
<p><strong>Other Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day. In children ages 1 to 3 years, the Recommended Dietary Allowance is 7 mg per day. Natural food sources of iron include certain fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. The Institute of Medicine also notes that nonheme iron, which is found in vegetarian diets, may be less well absorbed than heme iron, which is found in diets containing meat; therefore, the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet. Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods. Iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants. Federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and the iron content in enriched grain products has increased over the years. More than 50% of the iron in the U.S. food supply comes from iron fortified cereal grain products.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p>A research librarian searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the second quarter, 2014), and Medline (1996 to August 2014) for relevant studies to update the previous USPSTF reviews. Because the previous research focused on systematic reviews and key studies of treatments for iron deficiency anemia, they also searched the reference lists of systematic reviews to identify any additional, relevant studies published before 1996.</p>
<p>Studies were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria developed for each Key Question (KQ). Articles were selected for full review if they were related to iron deficiency anemia in children who received an intervention (supplementation or screening and related treatment) between the ages of 6 and 24 months. The reviewers restricted inclusion to English-language articles and excluded studies published only as abstracts. For all KQs, the focus was on studies that involved iron supplementation and treatment regimens commonly used in clinical practice in the United States. They excluded studies conducted in resource-poor populations, including nutritionally deficient populations in developing countries and populations in areas expected to have a high prevalence of hemoparasites, by selecting studies conducted in countries listed as having "high" or "very high" human development based on the international United Nations Human Development Index. At least 2 reviewers independently evaluated each study to determine eligibility.</p>
<p>Clinical outcomes of study were morbidity (including growth; cognitive, psychomotor, and neurodevelopmental outcomes; and diagnosis of developmental delay), mortality, and quality of life. Harm outcomes included accidental overdose, study discontinuations, and other harms related to screening, supplementation, or treatment. Included intermediate outcomes were incidence of iron deficiency anemia, iron deficiency, and anemia, as well as hematologic indices such as ferritin levels. Randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled clinical trials, and controlled cohort studies were included for all KQs.</p></div></p>

<p>*<em>A, B, C, D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct randomized controlled trial&nbsp;evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the USPSTF constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each Key Question (KQ), the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the KQ(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the KQ(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the KQs to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each KQ plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each KQ&mdash;even evidence from screening randomized controlled trials or treatment randomized controlled trials&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in randomized controlled trials and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the KQs in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in randomized controlled trials may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all KQs together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several randomized controlled trials of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, KQs, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>
<p>Sawaya GF, Guirguis-Blake J, LeFevre M, Harris R, Petitti D; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Update on the methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: estimating certainty and magnitude of net benefit. Ann Intern Med. 2007;147(12):871-875. [5 references].</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>For I statements, the USPSTF has a plan to commission its Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPCs) to collect information in 4 domains pertinent to clinical decisions about prevention and to report this information routinely. This plan is described in the paper: Petitti DB et al. Update on the methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: insufficient evidence. Ann Intern Med. 2009;150:199-205. <a href="/web/20180712205328/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49613&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.annals.org" title="Annals of Internal Medicine Web site">www.annals.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712205328im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/></p>
<p>The first domain is potential preventable burden of suffering from the condition. When evidence is insufficient, provision of an intervention designed to prevent a serious condition (such as dementia) might be viewed more favorably than provision of a service designed to prevent a condition that does not cause as much suffering (such as rash). The USPSTF recognized that "burden of suffering" is subjective and involves judgment. In clinical settings, it should be informed by patient values and concerns.</p>
<p>The second domain is potential harm of the intervention. When evidence is insufficient, an intervention with a large potential for harm (such as major surgery) might be viewed less favorably than an intervention with a small potential for harm (such as advice to watch less television). The USPSTF again acknowledges the subjective nature and the difficulty of assessing potential harms: for example, how bad is a "mild" stroke?</p>
<p>The third domain is cost&mdash;not just monetary cost, but opportunity cost, in particular the amount of time a provider spends to provide the service, the amount of time the patient spends to partake of it, and the benefits that might derive from alternative uses of the time or money for patients, clinicians, or systems. Consideration of clinician time is especially important for preventive services with only insufficient evidence because providing them could "crowd out" provision of preventive services with proven value, services for conditions that require immediate action, or services more desired by the patient. For example, a decision to routinely inspect the skin could take up the time available to discuss smoking cessation, or to address an acute problem or a minor injury that the patient considers important.</p>
<p>The fourth domain is current practice. This domain was chosen because it is important to clinicians for at least 2 reasons. Clinicians justifiably fear that not doing something that is done on a widespread basis in the community may lead to litigation. More important, addressing patient expectations is a crucial part of the clinician&ndash;patient relationship in terms of building trust and developing a collaborative therapeutic relationship. The consequences of not providing a service that is neither widely available nor widely used are less serious than not providing a service accepted by the medical profession and thus expected by patients. Furthermore, ingrained care practices are difficult to change, and efforts should preferentially be directed to changing those practices for which the evidence to support change is compelling.</p>
<p>Although the reviewers did not explicitly recognize it when these domains were chosen, the domains all involve consideration of the potential consequences&mdash;for patients, clinicians, and systems&mdash;of providing or not providing a service. Others writing about medical decision making in the face of uncertainty have suggested that the consequences of action or inaction should play a prominent role in decisions.</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></span> </p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from March 31 to April 27, 2015. A few comments requested more information on which populations are at increased risk for iron deficiency anemia and to which population the recommendation applies. Existing language describing risk factors for iron deficiency anemia and the target population for this recommendation was inserted earlier in the statement to make this information clearer. Some comments also requested separate analyses of certain high-risk populations. Although the USPSTF sought this information, limitations in the evidence prevented it from performing separate analyses. A few comments noted that there was ambiguity in how the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" were used. The recommendation was reviewed to ensure consistent use of each term and language was added to better explain that the focus of the recommendation is on iron deficiency anemia.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</strong></span></p>
<p>Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).</p></div></p>

<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found inadequate evidence on the effect of routine screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months on growth or child cognitive, psychomotor, or neurodevelopment outcomes. The USPSTF found no studies that evaluated the direct effect of routine screening programs on child health outcomes. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence (i.e., no recent studies that are generalizable to the current U.S. population) on the effects of treatment of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 24 months on growth or child cognitive or neurodevelopmental outcomes. No studies directly assessed the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes.

    <li>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specific clinical preventive services for patients without related signs or symptoms. </li>
    <li>It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the benefits and harms of the service and an assessment of the balance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a service in this assessment. </li>
    <li>The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the evidence but individualize decision making to the specific patient or situation. Similarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and coverage decisions involve considerations in addition to the evidence of clinical benefits and harms. </li>
    <li>Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="/web/20180712205328/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49613&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2f" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712205328im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div></p>
