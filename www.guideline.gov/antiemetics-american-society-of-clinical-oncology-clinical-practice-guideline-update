Olanzapine should be continued on days 2 to 4 (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2. What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting from moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents in adults who receive single-day antineoplastic agent therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Adult patients who are treated with carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) &ge; 4 mg/mL per minute should be offered a three-drug combination of an NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: Adult patients who are treated with moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents&mdash;excluding carboplatin AUC &ge; 4 mg/mL per minute&mdash;should be offered a two-drug combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (day 1) and dexamethasone (day 1) (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.3</em>: Adult patients who are treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, and other moderate-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents that are known to cause delayed nausea and vomiting may be offered dexamethasone on days 2 to 3 (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 3. What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting from low-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents in adults who receive single-day antineoplastic agent therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3</em>: Adult patients who are treated with low-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should be offered a single dose of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist or a single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before antineoplastic treatment (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 4. What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting from minimal-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents in adults who receive single-day antineoplastic agent therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em>: Adult patients who are treated with minimal-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should not be offered routine antiemetic prophylaxis (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 5. What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting in adults who receive single-day combination antineoplastic agent therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5</em>: Adult patients who are treated with antineoplastic combinations should be offered antiemetics that are appropriate for the component antineoplastic agent of greatest emetic risk (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 6. What is the role of adjunctive drugs for nausea and vomiting after cancer treatments? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6</em>: Lorazepam is a useful adjunct to antiemetic drugs but is not recommended as a single-agent antiemetic (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 7. What is the role of cannabinoids in the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting induced by antineoplastic agents or radiation? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em>: Evidence remains insufficient for a recommendation regarding medical marijuana for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer who receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Evidence is also insufficient for a recommendation regarding the use of medical marijuana in place of the tested and U.S. Food and Drug Administration&ndash;approved cannabinoids, dronabinol and nabilone, for the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 8. What is the role of complementary and alternative therapies in the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting induced by antineoplastic agents or radiation? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8</em>: Evidence remains insufficient for a recommendation for or against the use of ginger, acupuncture/acupressure, and other complementary or alternative therapies for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 9. What is the optimal treatment for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients who are undergoing high-dose chemotherapy for stem cell or bone marrow transplantation conditioning?</strong> </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9</em>: Adult patients who are treated with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell or bone marrow transplantation should be offered a three-drug combination of an NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 10. What is the optimal treatment for the prevention of nausea and vomiting for adults who receive multiday antineoplastic agent therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 10.1</em>: Adult patients who are treated with multiday antineoplastic agents should be offered antiemetics before treatment that are appropriate for the emetic risk of the antineoplastic agent administered on each day of the antineoplastic treatment and for 2 days after completion of the antineoplastic regimen (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 10.2</em>: Adult patients who are treated with 4- or 5-day cisplatin regimens should be offered a three-drug combination of an NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 11. What is the optimal antiemetic regimen for adults who experience nausea and vomiting secondary to therapy with an antineoplastic agent despite optimal prophylaxis (breakthrough)? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 11.1</em>: For patients with breakthrough nausea or vomiting, clinicians should re-evaluate emetic risk, disease status, concurrent illnesses, and medications and ascertain that the best regimen is being administered for the emetic risk (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 11.2</em>: Adult patients who experience nausea or vomiting despite optimal prophylaxis, and who did not receive olanzapine prophylactically, should be offered olanzapine in addition to continuing the standard antiemetic regimen (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 11.3</em>: Adult patients who experience nausea or vomiting despite optimal prophylaxis, and who have already received olanzapine, may be offered a drug of a different class&mdash;for example, an NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, lorazepam or alprazolam, a dopamine receptor antagonist, dronabinol, or nabilone&mdash;in addition to continuing the standard antiemetic regimen (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate for dronabinol and nabilone, low otherwise; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 12. What treatment options are available for adults who experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 12</em>: All patients should receive the most active antiemetic regimen appropriate for the antineoplastic agents being administered. Clinicians should use such regimens with initial antineoplastic treatment, rather than assessing the patient's emetic response with less effective antiemetic treatment. If a patient experiences anticipatory emesis, clinicians may offer behavioral therapy with systematic desensitization (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Adults</strong></span></p>
<p>Updated risk stratification according to site of radiation treatment is provided in Table 4 in the original guideline document. Dosing schedules according to risk are listed in Table 5 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 13. What is the optimal prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting caused by high-emetic-risk radiation? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 13</em>: Adult patients who are treated with high-emetic-risk radiation therapy should be offered a two-drug combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone before each fraction and on the day after each fraction if radiation therapy is not planned for that day (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 14. What is the optimal prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting caused by moderate-emetic-risk radiation therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 14</em>: Adult patients who are treated with moderate-emetic-risk radiation therapy should be offered a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist before each fraction, with or without dexamethasone before the first five fractions (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 15. What is the optimal treatment to manage nausea and vomiting associated with low-emetic-risk radiation therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 15</em>: Adult patients who are treated with radiation therapy to the brain should be offered rescue dexamethasone therapy. Adult patients who are treated with radiation therapy to the head and neck, thorax, or pelvis should be offered rescue therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or a dopamine receptor antagonist (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 16. What is the optimal treatment to manage nausea and vomiting associated with minimal-emetic-risk radiation therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 16</em>: Adult patients who are treated with minimal-emetic-risk radiation therapy should be offered rescue therapy with a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or a dopamine receptor antagonist (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 17. What is the optimal treatment for the management of nausea and vomiting during concurrent radiation and antineoplastic agent therapy? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 17</em>: Adult patients who are treated with concurrent radiation and antineoplastic agents should receive antiemetic therapy that is appropriate for the emetic risk level of the antineoplastic agents, unless the risk level of the radiation therapy is higher. During periods when prophylactic antiemetic therapy for the antineoplastic agents has ended and ongoing radiation therapy would normally be managed with its own prophylactic therapy, patients should receive prophylactic therapy that is appropriate for the emetic risk of the radiation therapy until the next period of antineoplastic therapy, rather than receiving rescue therapy for the antineoplastic agents as needed (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Antineoplastic Agent-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Pediatric Patients</strong></span></p>
<p>Pediatric clinicians should consult recognized pediatric drug formularies for information regarding appropriate pediatric dosing of antiemetic agents. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 18. What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting from high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents in pediatric patients? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 18.1</em>: Pediatric patients who are treated with high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents should be offered a three-drug combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 18.2</em>: Pediatric patients who are treated with high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents who are unable to receive aprepitant should be offered a two-drug combination of a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist and dexamethasone (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><em>Recommendation 18.3</em>: Pediatric patients who are treated with high-emetic-risk antineoplastic agents who are unable to receive dexamethasone should be offered a two-drug combination of palonosetron and aprepitant (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systematic Literature Review</strong></span></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. </p>
<p>PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched from November 1, 2009, to June 1, 2016. The updated search was restricted to articles that were published in English and to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs. Search terms are listed in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). RCTs were required to have at least 25 patients per arm and at least 5 days&mdash;120 hours&mdash;of follow-up. The updated search was guided by the signals approach that is designed to identify only new, potentially practice-changing data&mdash;signals&mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. This approach relies on targeted routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO Expert Panel members to help identify potential signals. The Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides additional information on the signals approach.</p>
<p>As in the 2011 ASCO guideline, the emetic risk of antineoplastic mediations was classified by using four levels based on the likelihood of emesis in the absence of antiemetic prophylaxis: high (&gt;90%), moderate (30% to 90%), low (10% to 30%), and minimal (&lt;10%). The 2011 ASCO guideline only addressed the emetic risk of intravenous (IV) antineoplastic agents. To update that list as well as to add information about the emetic risk of oral antineoplastic agents, the Expert Panel incorporated information from a 2016 publication by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO). The Expert Panel also updated the MASCC/ESMO search to identify drugs that had been approved since their review. For these additional drugs, the Expert Panel collected information and classified emetic risk according to methods developed by MASCC/ESMO.</p>
<p>Radiation treatments were also classified as posing a high, moderate, low, or minimal risk of inducing nausea and vomiting, depending on the anatomic region being irradiated. No other patient-, tumor-, or treatment-related factors presently inform this classification. The incidence of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting after radiation therapy to many anatomic regions remains unclear as a result of heterogeneity among study patient populations, designs, outcome measures, total doses, doses per fraction, doses administered to individual organs, target volumes, and radiation therapy techniques. The Expert Panel supports the four-level risk classification for radiation-induced nausea and vomiting but notes that evidence for radiation-induced nausea and vomiting and its relationship to discrete irradiated anatomic regions is limited, especially for low- and minimal-emetic-risk radiation therapy. In addition, most of the evidence for radiation-induced nausea and vomiting was collected before the widespread implementation of highly conformal radiation therapy techniques that likely modulate the risk of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting.</p></div></p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened an Expert Panel to consider the evidence and formulate the recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were drawn from both community and academic settings and have expertise in medical oncology, radiation oncology, nursing, pharmacy, and health services research. The panel also included a patient representative. The Expert Panel met via teleconference and in person and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of a consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize guideline recommendations. Recommendations developed by the Expert Panel are based on a systematic review of the medical literature and clinical experience.</p>
<p>Guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using the Guidelines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodology. In addition, a review of the ability to implement the guideline was conducted. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation and the quality of the evidence are provided with each recommendation. In selected cases in which evidence was lacking&mdash;but there was a high level of agreement among Expert Panel members&mdash;informal consensus was used.</p></div></p>

The use of such words as "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an as is basis and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information, or for any errors or omissions. </li>
