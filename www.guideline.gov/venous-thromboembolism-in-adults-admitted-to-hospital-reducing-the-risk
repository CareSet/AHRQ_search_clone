<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reducing the Risk of VTE</span></strong></p>
<p>Do not allow patients to become dehydrated unless clinically indicated. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Encourage patients to mobilise as soon as possible. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Do not regard aspirin or other antiplatelet agents as adequate prophylaxis for VTE. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Consider offering temporary inferior vena caval filters to patients who are at very high risk of VTE (such as patients with a previous VTE event or an active malignancy) and for whom mechanical and pharmacological VTE prophylaxis are contraindicated. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Using VTE Prophylaxis</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Mechanical VTE Prophylaxis</strong></p>
<p>Base the choice of mechanical VTE prophylaxis on individual patient factors including clinical condition, surgical procedure and patient preference. Choose any one of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Anti-embolism stockings (thigh or knee length) </li>
    <li>Foot impulse devices </li>
    <li>Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (thigh or knee length) <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>For patients who are admitted for stroke see the "Medical Patients" section below. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><em>Anti-embolism Stockings</em></p>
<p>Do not offer anti-embolism stockings to patients who have:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Suspected or proven peripheral arterial disease </li>
    <li>Peripheral arterial bypass grafting </li>
    <li>Peripheral neuropathy or other causes of sensory impairment </li>
    <li>Any local conditions in which stockings may cause damage, for example fragile 'tissue paper' skin, dermatitis, gangrene or recent skin graft </li>
    <li>Known allergy to material of manufacture </li>
    <li>Cardiac failure </li>
    <li>Severe leg oedema or pulmonary oedema from congestive heart failure </li>
    <li>Unusual leg size or shape </li>
    <li>Major limb deformity preventing correct fit </li>
</ul>
<p>Use caution and clinical judgement when applying anti-embolism stockings over venous ulcers or wounds. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that patients who need anti-embolism stockings have their legs measured and that the correct size of stocking is provided. Anti-embolism stockings should be fitted and patients shown how to use them by staff trained in their use. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that patients who develop oedema or postoperative swelling have their legs re-measured and anti-embolism stockings refitted. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>If arterial disease is suspected, seek expert opinion before fitting anti-embolism stockings. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Use anti-embolism stockings that provide graduated compression and produce a calf pressure of 14&ndash;15 mmHg. (This relates to a pressure of 14&ndash;18 mmHg at the ankle and is in line with British Standards <a href="/web/20180712190259/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49437&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fshop.bsigroup.com%2fProductDetail%2f%3fpid%3d000000000000138635" title="BSI Web site">6612:1985 Specification for graduated compression hosiery</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712190259im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> and <a href="/web/20180712190259/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49437&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fshop.bsigroup.com%2fen%2fProductDetail%2f%3fpid%3d000000000000311221" title="BSI Web site">7672:1993 Specification for compression, stiffness and labelling of anti-embolism hosiery</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712190259im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>.) <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Encourage patients to wear their anti-embolism stockings day and night until they no longer have significantly reduced mobility. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>

    <p>Continue pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until the patient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spinal Injury</strong></p>
<p>Offer combined VTE prophylaxis with mechanical and pharmacological methods to patients with spinal injury. Regularly reassess the patient's risks of VTE and bleeding.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Start mechanical VTE prophylaxis at admission or as early as clinically possible. Choose any one of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Anti-embolism stockings (thigh or knee length), used with caution (see "Using VTE Prophylaxis" above) </li>
        <li>Foot impulse devices </li>
        <li>Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (thigh or knee length) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Continue mechanical VTE prophylaxis until the patient no longer has significantly reduced mobility.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If the benefits of reducing the risk of VTE outweigh the risks of bleeding (see Box 2 above) and the bleeding risk has been established as low, add pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. Choose one of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>LMWH </li>
        <li>UFH (for patients with severe renal impairment or established renal failure) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Continue pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until the patient no longer has significantly reduced mobility. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Limb Plaster Casts</strong></p>
<p>Consider offering pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to patients with lower limb plaster casts after evaluating the risks (see "Assessing the Risks of VTE and Bleeding" above) and benefits based on clinical discussion with the patient. Offer LMWH (or UFH for patients with severe renal impairment of established renal failure) until lower limb plaster cast removal. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and Up to 6 Weeks Postpartum</strong></p>
<p>Consider offering pharmacological VTE prophylaxis with LMWH (or UFH for patients with severe renal impairment or established renal failure) to women who are pregnant or have given birth within the previous 6 weeks who are admitted to hospital but are not undergoing surgery, and who have one or more of the following risk factors:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Expected to have significantly reduced mobility for 3 or more days </li>
    <li>Active cancer or cancer treatment </li>
    <li>Age over 35 years </li>
    <li>Critical care admission </li>
    <li>Dehydration </li>
    <li>Excess blood loss or blood transfusion </li>
    <li>Known thrombophilias </li>
    <li>Obesity (pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy BMI over 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) </li>
    <li>One or more significant medical comorbidities (for example: heart disease; metabolic, endocrine or respiratory pathologies; acute infectious diseases; inflammatory conditions) </li>
    <li>Personal history or a first-degree relative with a history of VTE </li>
    <li>Pregnancy-related risk factor (such as ovarian hyperstimulation, hyperemesis gravidarum, multiple pregnancy or pre-eclampsia) </li>
    <li>Varicose veins with phlebitis <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider offering combined VTE prophylaxis with mechanical methods and LMWH (or UFH for patients with severe renal impairment or established renal failure) to women who are pregnant or have given birth within the previous 6 weeks who are undergoing surgery, including caesarean section. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Offer mechanical and/or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to women who are pregnant or have given birth within the previous 6 weeks only after assessing the risks and benefits and discussing these with the woman and with healthcare professionals who have knowledge of the proposed method of VTE prophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum. Plan when to start and stop pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to minimise the risk of bleeding. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Critical Care</strong></p>
<p>Assess all patients on admission to the critical care unit for their risks of VTE and bleeding (see "Assessing the Risks of VTE and Bleeding" above). Reassess patients' risks of VTE and bleeding daily and more frequently if their clinical condition is changing rapidly. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Offer VTE prophylaxis to patients admitted to the critical care unit according to the reason for admission, taking into account:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Any planned interventions </li>
    <li>The use of other therapies that may increase the risk of complications <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Review decisions about VTE prophylaxis for patients in critical care daily and more frequently if their clinical condition is changing rapidly. Take into account the known views of the patient, comments from their family and/or carers and the multidisciplinary team. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Patients Already Having Antiplatelet Agents or Anticoagulation on Admission or Needing Them for Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Consider offering additional mechanical or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to patients who are having antiplatelet agents to treat other conditions and who are assessed to be at increased risk of VTE. Take into account the risk of bleeding (see "Assessing the Risks of VTE and Bleeding" above) and of comorbidities such as arterial thrombosis.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding, consider offering pharmacological VTE prophylaxis according to the reason for admission. </li>
    <li>If the risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of VTE, offer mechanical VTE prophylaxis. <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not offer additional pharmacological or mechanical VTE prophylaxis to patients who are taking vitamin K antagonists and who are within their therapeutic range, providing anticoagulant therapy is continued. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Do not offer additional pharmacological or mechanical VTE prophylaxis to patients who are having full anticoagulant therapy (for example, fondaparinux sodium, LMWH or UFH). <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Patient Information and Planning for Discharge</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Patient Information</strong></p>
<p>Be aware that heparins are of animal origin and this may be of concern to some patients.<sup>5</sup> For patients who have concerns about using animal products, consider offering synthetic alternatives based on clinical judgement and after discussing their suitability, advantages and disadvantages with the patient. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Before starting VTE prophylaxis, offer patients and/or their families or carers verbal and written information on:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The risks and possible consequences of VTE </li>
    <li>The importance of VTE prophylaxis and its possible side effects </li>
    <li>The correct use of VTE prophylaxis (for example, anti-embolism stockings, foot impulse or intermittent pneumatic compression devices) </li>
    <li>How patients can reduce their risk of VTE (such as keeping well hydrated and, if possible, exercising and becoming more mobile) <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planning for Discharge</strong></p>
<p>As part of the discharge plan, offer patients and/or their families or carers verbal and written information on:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The signs and symptoms of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) </li>
    <li>The correct and recommended duration of use of VTE prophylaxis at home (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>The importance of using VTE prophylaxis correctly and continuing treatment for the recommended duration (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>The signs and symptoms of adverse events related to VTE prophylaxis (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Understand the benefits of wearing them </li>
    <li>Understand the need for daily hygiene removal </li>
    <li>Are able to remove and replace them, or have someone available who will be able to do this for them </li>
    <li>Know what to look for, such as skin marking, blistering or discolouration, particularly over the heels and bony prominences </li>
    <li>Know who to contact if there is a problem <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that patients who are discharged with pharmacological and/or mechanical VTE prophylaxis are able to use it correctly, or have arrangements made for someone to be available who will be able to help them. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Notify the patient's general practitioner if the patient has been discharged with pharmacological and/or mechanical VTE prophylaxis to be used at home. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') when confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><em>Interventions That Could Be Used</em></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</em></p>
<p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2010]</strong>. In particular, for recommendations labelled <strong>[2010]</strong> the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Acute and Chronic Conditions (NCC-ACC) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and for the addendum, which contains details and evidence used in the 2015 update.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Developing the Clinical Questions</strong></p>
<p>Clinical questions were developed to guide the literature searching process and to facilitate the development of recommendations by the Guideline Development Group (GDG). The clinical questions were initially drafted by the review team and were refined and validated by the GDG. The questions were based on the scope (see Appendix A in the full guideline appendices [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the literature search was to find evidence within the published literature in order to answer the clinical questions identified. Clinical databases were searched using filters (or hedges), using relevant medical subject headings and free-text terms. Non-English studies and abstracts were not reviewed. Searches were conducted to update the previous guideline.</p>
<p>Each database was searched up to 10 December 2008. One initial search was performed and then two update searches nearer the end of guideline development period. No papers after this date were considered. After the first draft of the guideline had been returned after stakeholder consultation a new study presenting results of the effectiveness of stockings in stroke patients was published in June 2009. This study reported new evidence on the use of stockings in stroke patients. The GDG decided the study should be included and felt that recommendations concerning the use of stockings should be reconsidered. To ensure all stockings studies published since the last searches in December 2008 were identified the search for evidence on stockings was updated to 9 June 2009.</p>
<p>The search strategies can be found in Appendix C in the full guideline appendices.</p>
<p>The following databases were searched:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Cochrane Library up to Issue 4 2008 </li>
    <li>Medline 1950-2008 (OVID) </li>
    <li>EMBASE 1980-2008 (OVID) </li>
    <li>Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) 1982-2008 (National Library for Health [NLH] Search 2.0) </li>
    <li>Health Economic and Evaluations Database (HEED) up to December 2008 </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Literature Reviewing Process</strong></p>
<p>References identified by the systematic literature search were screened for appropriateness by title and abstract by an information scientist and systematic reviewer. Studies were selected that reported one or more venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcome (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) determined by objective/reliable methods. Reviewers did not select studies that reported only major bleeding outcomes, but where an included systematic review reported such studies, they were not removed. The GDG also suggested further references and these were assessed in the same way.</p>
<p>Selected studies were ordered and assessed in full by a systematic reviewer using agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria specific to the guideline topic, and using NICE methodology quality assessment checklists appropriate to the study design. These are described in the NICE guidelines manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><em>Literature Review for Patient View Studies</em></p>
<p>Information of patient views regarding thromboprophylaxis and adherence are often more appropriately studied using non-randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs (i.e., qualitative studies, surveys of patients in observational studies). Unlike interventional studies, there is no established hierarchy of evidence to answer questions on patient views; observational or qualitative designs are not necessarily of lower quality than RCTs. Therefore, no study design limitation was included in the search and review of evidence. Relevant studies where the methods were clearly reported, appropriately designed to answer the study questions and met the quality assessment were included.</p>
<p><strong>Health Economic Methods</strong></p>
<p><em>Literature Review for Health Economics</em></p>
<p>Reviewers obtained published economic evidence from a systematic search of the following databases:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Cochrane Library up to Issue 4 2008 </li>
    <li>Medline 1950-2008 (OVID) </li>
    <li>EMBASE 1980-2008 (OVID) </li>
    <li>HEED up to December 2008 </li>
</ul>
<p>The information specialists used the same search strategy as for the clinical questions, using an economics filter in the place of a systematic review or RCT filter. Each database was searched from its start date up to December 2008. Papers identified after this date were not considered. Search strategies can be found in Appendix C in the full guideline appendices.</p>
<p>Each search strategy was designed to find any applied study estimating the cost or cost-effectiveness of an included prophylaxis intervention. A health economist reviewed the abstracts. Relevant references in the bibliographies of reviewed papers were also identified and reviewed.</p>
<p>Papers were excluded from the review and evidence tables if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The population and interventions were covered by an original guideline cost-effectiveness analysis </li>
    <li>The study did not contain any original data on cost or cost-effectiveness (that is, it was a review or a clinical paper) </li>
    <li>The analysis was not incremental and was not described adequately to allow incremental analysis (so studies reporting only average cost-effectiveness ratios were excluded unless they provided data to allow the calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) </li>
    <li>Cost analyses were excluded if the results were not presented in a way that would allow the incremental cost per patient to be extracted or derived </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Update</span></strong></p>
<p>The aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of different mechanical methods of VTE prophylaxis (excluding elastic graduated compression stockings) in hospitalised stroke patients compared to no prophylaxis or routine care. A systematic search was conducted. An additional search was conducted using the same search terms with an economic filter to identify studies assessing the cost-effectiveness of mechanical prophylaxis of VTE.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Acute and Chronic Conditions (NCC-ACC) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and for the addendum, which contains details and evidence used in the 2015 update.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Reviewing Process</strong></p>
<p><em>Literature Review for Patient View Studies</em></p>
<p>Qualitative studies were quality assessed using checklists from the NICE guideline manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and only studies rated as '+' or '++' were included.</p>
<p>The questionnaires used in the various patient view studies found in the searches did not report on how they were designed and validated. This is a major methodological limitation for all studies using questionnaires in this guideline.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of patient adherence come with potential biases and limitations. For example, the informed consent process and strict inclusion criteria of RCTs may contribute to better informed or motivated patients. In addition, participation in RCTs is usually associated with closer monitoring and better level of support. This may result in higher adherence than may be expected in routine practise. Adherence may also be higher in studies where patients were checked hourly for adherence or where self-reports were used. However, when a range of results are observed in different study designs and settings, these provide a useful indication of the types of issues that might be expected from the interventions in usual practice.</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Combining Direct Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted to combine the results of studies addressing the same clinical question using Cochrane's Review Manager Software. Random effects method (Der Simonian and Laird model) was used to calculate risk ratios (relative risk) of an event occurring, that is, all cause mortality, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) or major bleeding. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by considering the chi-squared and the I-squared test. Significant heterogeneity was noted for any study where the I-squared value was &gt;50%, or the I-squared value was between 25% and 50% and the chi-squared value was p &lt;0.1. Reviewers carried out sensitivity analyses to identify studies whose results were heterogeneous to the overall result. Any such studies were further assessed to identify any clinical or methodological causes. Reviewers avoided removing these studies from the meta-analyses unless a serious methodological flaw was identified, as removal would introduce bias into the systematic review.</p>
<p>Where combining results of trials in a meta-analysis was not appropriate a narrative synthesis of studies was undertaken.</p>
<p><strong>Methods for Combining Direct and Indirect Evidence</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to determine the most effective prophylaxis strategy from the results of conventional meta-analyses of direct evidence for three reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Some pairs of alternative strategies have not been directly compared in an RCT (for example, aspirin vs. fondaparinux). </li>
    <li>Sometimes the direct evidence does not provide enough data and needs to be supported with indirect evidence. </li>
    <li>There are frequently multiple overlapping comparisons (for example, heparin vs. no prophylaxis, heparin vs. stockings and stockings vs. no prophylaxis), that potentially give inconsistent estimates of effect. </li>
</ol>
<p>To overcome these problems, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted that simultaneously pools together all the data. This allowed reviewers to rank the different prophylaxis interventions in order of efficacy at reducing DVTs and PEs and in order of risk of major bleeding. For each of these two outcomes, it gives a single estimate of effect (with confidence intervals [CIs]) for each intervention compared with no prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 3.10 in the full version of the guideline for a list of interventions that were included and excluded from the network meta-analysis.</p>
<p><em>The Model</em></p>
<p>A hierarchical Bayesian NMA method was performed using the software WinBUGS. This specific method is usually referred to as mixed-treatment comparisons analysis but the term network meta-analysis is used to refer generically to this kind of analysis. The term 'network' better describes the data structure, whereas 'mixed treatments' could easily be misinterpreted as referring to combinations of treatments.</p>
<p>Reviewers adapted a program on the University of Bristol Web site (<a href="/web/20180712190259/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=49437&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.bris.ac.uk%2fcobm%2fresearch%2fmpes%2fmixed-treatment-comparisons.html" title="University of Bristol Web site">https://www.bris.ac.uk/cobm/research/mpes/mixed-treatment-comparisons.html</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712190259im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. Last accessed 20th January 2009). The model accounts for the correlation between arms in three-arm trials. Reviewers had no four-arm trials in their analysis.</p>
<p>In order to be included in the analysis, a fundamental requirement is that each treatment is connected directly or indirectly to every other intervention in the network. For each population subgroup reviewers have produced a diagram of the evidence network to show which interventions have been included. Trials with zero events in each arm were excluded since these do not contain evidence relevant to the analysis. This explains, in part at least, why there are far fewer trials in the NMAs of PE compared with the NMAs of DVT. Refer to Section 3.10 in the full version of the guideline for additional details on the NMAs.</p>
<p><strong>Health Economic Methods</strong></p>
<p>It is important to investigate whether health services are cost-effective (that is, value for money). If a particular prophylaxis or treatment strategy were found to yield little health gain relative to the resources used, then it would be advantageous to re-deploy resources to other activities that yield greater health gain.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Update</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Evidence</strong></p>
<p>This update was developed based on the process and methods described in the NICE guidelines manual 2012 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Where there are deviations from the process and methods, these are clearly stated in the Interim process and methods guide for updates pilot programme 2013.</p>
<p><em>Methods</em></p>
<p>During development of the review protocol, the topic expert members of the Committee were asked to prioritise patient important outcomes for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, ranking them from 1 (most important) to 7 (least important). Topic expert scores were compared and a final list of outcomes produced based on the average score. There was general consensus that development of symptomatic DVT and PE (fatal or non-fatal) were the most important outcomes for assessing effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis. For further information on the ranking of outcomes see Appendix C in the guideline addendum (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>There is some debate in the medical literature about the relative importance (for risk of PE) of distal versus proximal DVT. However, this distinction was not made for either of the DVT outcomes specified by the topic experts. Evidence was therefore only evaluated where studies reported a combined measure of distal and proximal DVT, or a combined rate could be calculated for the treatment and control groups.</p>
<p>The review protocol is shown in Appendix D in the guideline addendum. Intermittent pneumatic compression (including foot impulse devices) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) devices were identified as relevant interventions. Graduated compression stockings (GCS) were excluded because they are not recommended for use in acute stroke patients. However, studies comparing intermittent pneumatic compression or NMES used in conjunction with GCS (or with pharmacological prophylaxis) were eligible for inclusion if the comparison enabled the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression or NMES alone to be assessed (for example, 'intermittent pneumatic compression + stockings' vs 'stockings alone'). Other relevant comparators were routine care/no VTE prophylaxis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Appraisal</span></p>
<p>The quality of evidence was appraised for each important outcome using the criteria recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. See the guideline addendum for further details on evaluating risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, and imprecision for the update evidence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Analyses</span></p>
<p>Two trials included a post-treatment follow-up period (3 months and 6 months respectively). For these two studies, pooled data for DVT and all-cause mortality were meta-analysed using Review Manager 5 over three time points: (i) treatment period only, (ii) cumulative treatment + follow-up period, and (iii) post-treatment follow-up period only. These analyses may inform whether the effect of mechanical prophylaxis is merely to defer VTE events (in which case, the treatment group would be expected to show a differential increase in the post-treatment period), and whether any benefit of mechanical prophylaxis is sustained beyond the treatment phase (in which case, effect estimates would continue to favour the treatment group).</p>
<p>One large study reported relative risk ratios and 95% CI adjusted for four baseline variables that may be associated with VTE outcomes. These adjusted data are likely to be a more precise estimate of the true effect of mechanical prophylaxis so they were inputted (in preference to simple event rate data) into Review Manager 5, where available, for the dichotomous outcomes. The Generic Inverse Variance method used to do this generates forest plot output where the point estimate appears in red (for example, see Figure 2 in the guideline addendum). Where adjusted data were not available, event rates were inputted using the Mantel-Haenszel method, generating forest plot output in blue (for example, see Figure 3 in the guideline addendum). A fixed effects model was used for all analyses because of the small number of studies.</p>
<p>There were not sufficient data across studies to do the subgroup analyses specified in the review protocol (see Appendix D in the guideline addendum). However, one large multi-centre trial had undertaken some relevant pre-specified subgroup comparisons where the primary outcome was proximal DVT (symptomatic or asymptomatic). There are presented in Table 10 and forest plot Figures 18-22 in the addendum to inform decision-making.</p>
<p>For a summary of included studies please see Table 2 in the guideline addendum. For the full evidence tables and full GRADE profiles please see Appendices H and I in the guideline addendum.</p>

See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and for the addendum, which contains details and evidence used in the 2015 update.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising professional group members and consumer representatives of the main stakeholders developed this guideline (see section on Guideline Development Group Membership and acknowledgements in the full version of the guideline).</p>
<p>NICE funds the National Clinical Guideline Centre for Acute and Chronic Conditions, NCGC (formerly the National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care, NCC-AC) and thus supported the development of this guideline. The GDG was convened by the NCC-AC in accordance with guidance from NICE. The GDG met every 6 to 8 weeks during the development of the guideline.</p>
<p>A separate orthopaedic subgroup was set up in March 2008 to provide specific expert guidance on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for patients having orthopaedic surgery. This group comprised seven consultant orthopaedic surgeons representing a range of orthopaedic specialties along with a patient representatives and a nursing representative. The group met 5 times. This orthopaedic subgroup group reviewed the evidence for orthopaedic surgery and provided expert opinion and draft recommendations to the main GDG. The full GDG had the responsibility for final approval of all recommendations in the guideline.</p>
<p>Staff from the NCGC provided methodological support and guidance for the development process. They undertook systematic searches, retrieval and appraisal of the evidence and drafted the guideline.</p>
<p>See Section 3.3 in the full version of the guideline for information on developing the clinical questions.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the guideline development process the GDG was presented with the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence tables and narrative summaries of the clinical evidence reviewed. All evidence tables are in Appendix D in the full guideline appendices (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
    <li>Forest plots of direct meta-analysis (Appendix E in the full guideline appendices) </li>
    <li>Forest plots of network meta-analysis (Chapters 9 to 12, 23 in the full version of the guideline) </li>
    <li>A description of the methods for, and results of, the cost-effectiveness analysis (Chapter 4 and Chapters 9 to 12, 23 in the full version of the guideline) </li>
</ul>
<p>Although evidence was reviewed for every population, network meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis were only conducted for 5 populations, general medical patients, general surgical patients, hip fracture surgery, total hip replacement and total knee replacement. For these populations the recommendations were derived directly from the results of the analyses. If the decision was taken not to recommend the most cost effective strategy the GDG clearly explained their reasoning for this.</p>
<p>For populations which did not have cost effectiveness models conducted, recommendations were based on the direct evidence available for that population and from extrapolating the results from cost-effectiveness models in other populations. The link between evidence and the subsequent recommendations is explained in the relevant sections.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Update</span></strong></p>
<p>The NICE guideline Venous thromboembolism: reducing the risk in patients admitted to hospital (NICE clinical guideline 92) was reviewed in 2013 as part of NICE's routine surveillance programme to decide whether it required updating. The surveillance report identified new evidence relating to following area of the guidance:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Intermittent pneumatic compression in people admitted to hospital with recent stroke</li>
</ul>
<p>The guideline was updated using a standing committee of healthcare professionals, research methodologists and lay members from a range of disciplines and localities. For the duration of the update the core members of the Committee were joined by up to 5 additional members who have specific expertise in the topic being updated.</p>
<p>This update was developed based on the process and methods described in the NICE guidelines manual 2012 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Where there are deviations from the process and methods, these are clearly stated in the Interim process and methods guide for updates pilot programme 2013.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Update</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') when confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</strong></p>
<p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2010]</strong>. In particular, for recommendations labelled <strong>[2010]</strong> the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Cost Analysis</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>In this guideline an original cost-effectiveness analysis was performed which compared a variety of different prophylactic strategies for a number of different hospital population subgroups. In addition, a systematic review of the economic literature was conducted for populations or interventions not covered by the original cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p>The criteria applied for an intervention to be considered cost-effective were either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>The intervention dominated other relevant strategies (that is, it is both less costly in terms of resource use and more clinically effective compared with all the other relevant alternative strategies), <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>The intervention cost less than &pound;20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with the next best strategy (and compared with no prophylaxis). </li>
</ol>
<p>The full economic evaluation of any strategy has to be in comparison with another strategy:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Incremental cost: the mean cost of one strategy minus the mean cost of a comparator study </li>
    <li>QALYs gained: the mean QALYs associated one strategy minus the mean QALYs of a comparator study </li>
    <li>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: the incremental cost divided by the respective QALYs gained </li>
    <li>Incremental net benefit (INB): the (monetary) value of a strategy compared with an alternative strategy for a given cost-effectiveness threshold (For example: &pound;20,000 per QALY gained) </li>
</ul>
<p>In the cost-effectiveness analysis (see Chapter 4 in the full version of the guideline), the following formula was used to estimate the INB of each strategy:</p>
<p>INB = (QALYs gained compared with no prophylaxis x &pound;20,000) minus the incremental cost compared with no prophylaxis.</p>
<p>This indicates that to &pound;20,000 will be invested to gain one additional QALY. The strategy that has the highest INB is the optimal (that is, most cost-effective) strategy. Strategies that have a negative INB are not cost-effective even compared with no prophylaxis.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness Modelling</strong></p>
<p>The following general principles were adhered to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) was consulted during the construction and interpretation of the model. </li>
    <li>The model was based on a network meta-analysis derived from the systematic review of clinical evidence. </li>
    <li>Model assumptions were reported fully and transparently (see Chapter 4 in the full version of the guideline). </li>
    <li>The results were subject to thorough sensitivity analysis and limitations discussed. </li>
    <li>Costs were calculated from a health services perspective. </li>
</ul>
<p>Also see "Economic Considerations" for each recommendation in the full version of the guideline for conclusions derived from economic modeling. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Update</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Evidence</strong></p>
<p>An economic evaluation was conducted by the CLOTS Trials Collaboration based on the data collected during the CLOTS3 trial. Over a 6 month timeframe there was a mean difference in quality-adjusted survival of 0.9 days in favour of the intermittent pneumatic compression IPC group but this was not statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -2.1 to 3.9 days. The CLOTS3 authors found that the intermittent pneumatic compression arm was associated with an increased cost of &pound;451. The majority of this cost difference (&pound;387) was calculated using the mean difference in length of stay of 1.8 days (95% CI -1.0 to 4.5). The CLOTS3 authors reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &pound;610.88 per quality-adjusted life day with a high degree of uncertainty around this estimate. The CLOTS3 authors also reported the direct treatment cost of avoiding the conditions related to venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p>

<p><strong>Validation of Guideline</strong></p>
<p>Registered stakeholders were given the opportunity to comment on the draft guideline, which was posted on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Web site. A Guideline Review Panel also reviewed the guideline and checked that stakeholders' comments had been addressed.</p>
<p>A second consultation was conducted because the results of a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) was published after the first consultation. As a result of the second consultation, some changes were made for the General Medical Patients (Chapter 23 in the full version of the guideline) and Stroke Patients (Chapter 24 in the full version of the guideline) recommendations.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and its associated short and long term consequences and reducing unwanted effects of thromboprophylaxis methods are the most important outcomes. Increased patient awareness, adherence and correct use of prophylaxis methods could lead to a reduction in these VTE outcomes as well as improving the patient's experience and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Refer to the "Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms" sections of the full version of the guideline and the "Trade-off between benefits and harms" sections of the 2015 addendum (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for benefits of specific interventions.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For each of the recommendations about providing prophylaxis the potential benefits of reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events (symptomatic deep vein thrombosis [DVT], symptomatic pulmonary embolism [PE] and fatal PE) needs to be balanced against the potential harms of bleeding events (major bleeding, fatal bleeding and stroke). </li>
    <li>The timing of when pharmacological prophylaxis is started is particularly important in patients who have suffered a spontaneous or traumatic haemorrhage. The risk of bleeding is a serious complication in patients requiring emergency cranial or spinal surgery. In spinal surgery the catastrophic long term neurological consequences of extradural bleeding need to be balanced against the risk to life of VTE disease. </li>
    <li>An additional concern is the risk of developing an epidural haematoma as a result of the regional anaesthetic technique. Consequently, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) recommends that the timing of pharmacological prophylaxis should be carefully planned to minimise the risk of spinal haematoma if a regional anaesthetic technique is used. Patients using antiplatelets or anticoagulant agents may be at increased risk of bleeding. </li>
    <li>Poorly fitted stockings or those of an incorrect shape and size have the potential to cause a tourniquet effect on the proximal part of the limb where the stocking is applied. This can result in ischaemia and an increased risk of thrombosis development. </li>
    <li>Unlike pharmacological prophylaxis, mechanical methods do not increase the risk of bleeding. However, anti-embolism stockings have been shown to be ineffective in reducing the risk of VTE in stroke patients and were associated with an increased risk of cutaneous adverse reactions. </li>
    <li>Foot impulse or intermittent pneumatic compression devices do not increase the risk of bleeding but may cause damage to the skin. </li>
    <li>Although overall incidence was relatively low and no serious complications (such as amputation) were reported, intermittent pneumatic compression was associated in the CLOTS3 trial with a significant increase in skin necrosis (3.1% versus 1.4%). The Committee noted that skin breaks are a less important outcome than others under consideration, but may necessitate stopping intermittent pneumatic compression and can be potentially difficult to treat in immobile older patients. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the "Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms" sections of the full version of the guideline and the "Trade-off between benefits and harms" sections of the 2015 addendum (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional details on harms of specific interventions.</p></p>

    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summary of product characteristics of any drugs they are considering. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. </li>
    <li>This guideline recommends some medicines for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented.

<p>The following recommendations were identified as priorities for implementation in the 2010 guideline and have not been changed in the 2015 update.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Priorities for Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Assessing the Risks of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and Bleeding</strong></p>
<p>Assess all patients on admission to identify those who are at increased risk of VTE. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Regard medical patients as being at increased risk of VTE if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Have had or are expected to have significantly reduced mobility for 3 days or more <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>Are expected to have ongoing reduced mobility relative to their normal state and have one or more of the risk factors shown in Box 1 (see the "Major Recommendations" field) <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Regard surgical patients and patients with trauma as being at increased risk of VTE if they meet one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Surgical procedure with a total anaesthetic and surgical time of more than 90 minutes, or 60 minutes if the surgery involves the pelvis or lower limb </li>
    <li>Acute surgical admission with inflammatory or intra-abdominal condition </li>
    <li>Expected significant reduction in mobility </li>
    <li>One or more of the risk factors shown in Box 1 (see the "Major Recommendations" field) <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Assess all patients for risk of bleeding before offering pharmacological VTE prophylaxis.<sup>1</sup> Do not offer pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to patients with any of the risk factors for bleeding shown in Box 2 (see the "Major Recommendations" field), unless the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Reassess patients' risks of bleeding and VTE within 24 hours of admission and whenever the clinical situation changes, to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ensure that the methods of VTE prophylaxis being used are suitable </li>
    <li>Ensure that VTE prophylaxis is being used correctly </li>
    <li>Identify adverse events resulting from VTE prophylaxis <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reducing the Risk of VTE</strong></p>
<p>Encourage patients to mobilise as soon as possible. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p>Offer pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to general medical patients assessed to be at increased risk of VTE. Choose any one of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Fondaparinux sodium </li>
    <li>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)<sup>2</sup> </li>
    <li>Unfractionated heparin (UFH) (for patients with severe renal impairment or established renal failure) <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Start pharmacological VTE prophylaxis as soon as possible after risk assessment has been completed. Continue until the patient is no longer at increased risk of VTE. <strong>[2010]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Information and Planning for Discharge</strong></p>
<p>Before starting VTE prophylaxis, offer patients and/or their families or carers verbal and written information on:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The risks and possible consequences of VTE </li>
    <li>The importance of VTE prophylaxis and its possible side effects </li>
    <li>The correct use of VTE prophylaxis (for example, anti-embolism stockings, foot impulse or intermittent pneumatic compression devices) </li>
    <li>How patients can reduce their risk of VTE (such as keeping well hydrated and, if possible, exercising and becoming more mobile) <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the discharge plan, offer patients and/or their families or carers verbal and written information on:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) </li>
    <li>The correct and recommended duration of use of VTE prophylaxis at home (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>The importance of using VTE prophylaxis correctly and continuing treatment for the recommended duration (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>The signs and symptoms of adverse events related to VTE prophylaxis (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>The importance of seeking help and who to contact if they have any problems using the prophylaxis (if discharged with prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>The importance of seeking medical help and who to contact if DVT, PE or another adverse event is suspected <strong>[2010]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><sup>1</sup>Prescribers should consult the summary of product characteristics for the pharmacological VTE prophylaxis being used or planned for further details.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>2</sup>At the time of publication (June 2015) some types of LMWH do not have UK marketing authorisation for VTE prophylaxis in medical patients. Prescribers should consult the summary of product characteristics for the individual LMWH. Informed consent for off-label use should be obtained and documented.</p></div></p>
