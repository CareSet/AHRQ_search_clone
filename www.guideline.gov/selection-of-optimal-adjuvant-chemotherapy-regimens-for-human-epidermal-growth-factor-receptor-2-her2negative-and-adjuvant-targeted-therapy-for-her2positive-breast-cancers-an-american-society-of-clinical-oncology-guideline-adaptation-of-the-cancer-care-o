                        <h3><a href="#">Major Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The following sections present the recommendations adapted from the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Program in Evidence-based Care guideline on optimal systemic therapy for early female breast cancer. Recommendations identified by an asterisk are taken verbatim from the CCO guideline. Otherwise, recommendations have been substantively adapted or reworded for clarity by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Negative Breast Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of an Anthracycline-Taxane Regimen</strong></p>
<p>In patients who can tolerate it, use of a regimen containing anthracycline-taxane is considered the optimal strategy for adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly for patients deemed to be at high risk.*</p>
<p><strong>Optimal-Dose Anthracycline Regimen for Patients with High-Risk Breast Cancer Who Will Not Receive a Taxane</strong></p>
<p>For patients with high-risk disease who will not receive a taxane, an optimal-dose anthracycline three-drug regimen (cumulative dose of doxorubicin &ge;240 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or epirubicin &ge;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> but no higher than 720 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) that contains cyclophosphamide is recommended. The cumulative dose of doxorubicin in two-drug regimens should not exceed 240 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>The Oxford Overview showed that anthracycline-based three-drug regimens, such as six cycles of cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-fluorouracil (300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of doxorubicin) or cyclophosphamide-epirubicin-fluorouracil (&ge;360 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of epirubicin), were superior to cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil. However, studies of anthracycline-based two-drug regimens (versus single-agent paclitaxel) testing a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of more than 240 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in the form of doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide given for six cycles instead of four cycles or for four cycles with a doxorubicin dose of more than 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per cycle demonstrated greater toxicity and no improvement in survival. In light of these data, the ASCO Panel modified the CCO recommendation to indicate that the cumulative dose of doxorubicin in two-drug regimens should not exceed 240 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Gemcitabine or Capecitabine to an Anthracycline-Taxane Regimen</strong></p>
<p>The addition of gemcitabine or capecitabine to an anthracycline-taxane regimen is not recommended for adjuvant chemotherapy.*</p>
<p><strong>Capecitabine in Patients Age 65 Years or Older</strong></p>
<p>In patients age 65 years or older, capecitabine is not recommended as an adjuvant chemotherapy option in lieu of standard regimens such as doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (oral cyclophosphamide).</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>The ASCO Panel modified the CCO recommendation to reflect that patients in the clinical trial reported by Muss et al. were age 65 years or older.</p>
<p><strong>Cyclophosphamide-Methotrexate-Fluorouracil as an Alternative to Doxorubicin-Cyclophosphamide</strong></p>
<p>For patients in whom anthracycline-taxane is contraindicated, cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (with oral cyclophosphamide) is an acceptable chemotherapy alternative to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide. Of note, the ASCO Panel recommends classic cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (oral cyclophosphamide days 1 to 14 with intravenous [IV] methotrexate-fluorouracil days 1 and 8, repeated once every 28 days for six cycles) as the default adjuvant cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimen. However, the Panel also recognizes that an all-IV cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimen once every 21 days is often used in clinical practice and was accepted by some clinical trials (e.g., TAILORx [Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (Rx)]) on the basis of convenience and tolerability despite the absence of efficacy data from randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>In the Oxford Overview, trials that had controls treated with cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil showed that standard doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 once every 3 weeks and standard cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil were equivalent. However, single-agent taxane regimens such as paclitaxel given for four or six cycles are not acceptable alternatives because they were not shown to be not inferior to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide. The ASCO Panel modified the CCO recommendation to include a comment on the use of an all-IV cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptable Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimens for Patients with Higher-Risk Early-Stage Breast Cancer</strong></p>
<p>These adjuvant chemotherapy regimens can be used for patients with higher-risk early-stage breast cancer (see also the next recommendation regarding non-anthracycline regimens):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 3 &rarr; docetaxel &times; 3 (superior to fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 6) </li>
    <li>Doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 &rarr; docetaxel &times; 4 (superior to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide x 4) </li>
    <li>Docetaxel-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 6 (superior to fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 6) </li>
    <li>Doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 &rarr; paclitaxel administered once per week </li>
    <li>Dose-dense doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &rarr; paclitaxel (once every 2 weeks) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>The ASCO Panel modified the CCO list of acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy regimens to remove the "dose-dense, dose-intense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide &rarr; paclitaxel" regimen because of higher toxicity and lack of overall survival benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Adjuvant Regimen When an Anthracycline Is Not Preferred</strong></p>
<p>Docetaxel-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 is recommended as an alternative to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 4. Docetaxel-cyclophosphamide offers improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with four cycles of doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide. Classic cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil with cyclophosphamide for six cycles is another option. Of note, the ASCO Panel recommends classic cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (oral cyclophosphamide days 1 to 14 with IV methotrexate-fluorouracil days 1 and 8, repeated once every 28 days for six cycles) as the default adjuvant cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimen. However, the Panel also recognizes that an all-IV cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimen once every 21 days is often used in clinical practice and was accepted by some clinical trials (e.g., TAILORx) on the basis of convenience and tolerability despite the absence of efficacy data from randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>The US Oncology Trial 9735 showed that docetaxel-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 offers improved DFS and OS when compared with doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide &times; 4. However, docetaxel-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 is associated with a higher risk of infection, and use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is recommended. Docetaxel-cyclophosphamide &times; 4 has not been compared against an anthracycline and taxane regimen (in sequence or in combination). Ongoing trials NCT00493870 (Phase III Trial of Taxotere [Docetaxel]-Cytoxan [Cyclophosphamide] [TC] versus taxotere-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide [TAC] in HER2-Negative Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients), NCT01547741 (Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide Compared to Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy in Treating Women with HER2-Negative Breast Cancer), and NCT00887536 (A Clinical Trial Comparing the Combination of TC Plus Bevacizumab to TC Alone and to TAC for Women with Node-Positive or High-Risk Node-Negative, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer) are testing the efficacy (and safety) of docetaxel-cyclophosphamide &times; six cycles versus three-drug anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimens in high-risk HER2-negative, node-negative or node-positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>The ASCO Panel modified the CCO recommendation to specify that docetaxel-cyclophosphamide should be administered for four cycles and added the statement to the recommendation that, on the basis of the Oxford Overview, cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil for six cycles offers "equivalent" outcomes and is an alternative to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide once every 3 weeks &times; 4. The ASCO Panel also modified the CCO recommendation to include a comment on the use of an all-IV cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Selection and Adjuvant Trastuzumab Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Only patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (overexpressed based on immunohistochemistry [3+] or amplified based on in situ hybridization [ratio &ge;2.0 or average <em>HER2</em> copy number &ge;6.0]) should be offered adjuvant trastuzumab.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>The ASCO Panel modified the CCO patient selection recommendation slightly from CCO's original language of "6+ HER2 gene copies per cell nucleus" to make this one criterion consistent with the ASCO-College of American Pathologists guideline definition of "positive for HER2" as an average <em>HER2</em> gene copy number of &ge;6.0 per cell nucleus.</p>
<p><strong>Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in Patients with Higher-Risk HER2-Positive</strong></p>
<p>Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is recommended for all patients with HER2-positive, node-positive breast cancer and for patients with HER2-positive, node-negative breast cancer tumors (&ge;1 cm).*</p>
<p><strong>Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in Patients with HER2-Positive T1a-b N0 Disease</strong></p>
<p>Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy may be considered in small (&le;1 cm), node-negative tumors.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>The ASCO Panel adapted the CCO recommendation in light of data published since completion of the CCO guideline to make the recommendation more definitive regarding the use of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with small, node-negative tumors. There are limited phase III data on the efficacy of trastuzumab in patients with small (&le;1 cm), node-negative tumors. In a recent meta-analysis of five of six randomized trials that evaluated the benefit of trastuzumab in tumors &le;2 cm, only 75 patients had T1a-b node-negative disease, but the proportional benefit offered by adjuvant trastuzumab seemed to be the same regardless of tumor size or node status. Two single-arm phase II trials in the node-negative, HER2-positive population suggest an excellent short-term outcome for patients treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel (49.5% had T1b disease or smaller; two-thirds had estrogen receptor [ER]-positive disease) or with trastuzumab and docetaxel-cyclophosphamide (21.7% of patients had T1b disease or smaller; 64.9% had ER-positive disease). Although data from these single-arm studies are encouraging, they do not support a blanket recommendation for the use of trastuzumab-based chemotherapy for all patients with T1N0 HER2-positive tumors. Historical outcomes suggest excellent outcomes for some patients with T1a-b HER2-positive tumors that were not treated with trastuzumab, particularly those with ER-positive disease treated with optimal endocrine therapy. Therefore, the decision to offer trastuzumab-based chemotherapy for patients with small, node-negative tumors needs to be individualized.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Chemotherapy Regimens in Patients Receiving Trastuzumab</strong></p>
<p>Trastuzumab can be administered with any acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy regimen.*</p>
<p><strong>Use of Trastuzumab and an Anthracycline-Containing Regimen</strong></p>
<p>The administration of trastuzumab concurrently with the anthracycline component of a chemotherapy regimen is not recommended because of the potential for increased cardiotoxicity.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>Because of a lack of clinical outcomes benefit and increased cardiotoxicity, concurrent administration of anthracyclines and trastuzumab is not recommended; the ASCO Panel adapted the CCO recommendation to omit the word "generally" from the CCO recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Concurrent Administration of Adjuvant Trastuzumab and Non-Anthracycline Chemotherapy Regimens</strong></p>
<p>Trastuzumab should be preferentially administered concurrently (not sequentially) with a non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimen.</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>On the basis of data from North Central Cancer Treatment Group NCCTG-N9831 (Combination Chemotherapy with or without Trastuzumab in Treating Women with HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer) trial and on informal panel consensus, the ASCO Panel adapted the CCO recommendation to indicate a preference for concurrent versus sequential administration of trastuzumab and non-anthracycline chemotherapy. One study reported a strong trend toward improved DFS with initiation of trastuzumab concurrent with taxane chemotherapy compared with the sequential administration of taxane followed by trastuzumab once per week for 52 weeks (hazard ratio, 0.77; 99.9% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 1.11).</p>
<p><strong>Trastuzumab-Based Chemotherapy/Trastuzumab Regimens for Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiotoxicity</strong></p>
<p>Less cardiotoxicity is seen with docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab than with doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel-trastuzumab, and docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab is recommended for patients at higher risk for cardiotoxicity.*</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>Although the efficacy of docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab was not directly tested against doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel-trastuzumab in the Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG) 006 (Combination Chemotherapy with or without Trastuzumab in Treating Women with Breast Cancer) trial, lower rates of cardiotoxicity were observed with docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab. These data support preferential use of docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab, particularly for patients who might be at greater risk for cardiac dysfunction, on the basis of factors such as older age, low baseline ejection fraction, and pre-existing hypertension. Of note, BCIRG 006 did not include patients older than age 70 years. Another option for patients with lower-risk node-negative disease who might have a higher risk for cardiotoxicity is trastuzumab-paclitaxel once per week followed by trastuzumab alone on the basis of a single-arm phase II trial in which rates of symptomatic heart failure were low and the observed asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction improved with trastuzumab interruption and/or cessation.</p>
<p><strong>Addition of Trastuzumab to Chemotherapy Regimens Not Evaluated in a Phase III Trial</strong></p>
<p>No phase III evidence exists for the addition of trastuzumab to some chemotherapy regimens, such as docetaxel-cyclophosphamide. However, those regimens might be in use and are reasonable options, particularly to mitigate cardiotoxicity in certain patients.*</p>
<p><em>ASCO Panel Rationale and Discussion</em></p>
<p>Since publication of the CCO guideline, data from two phase II studies have assessed the concomitant administration of taxanes and trastuzumab. The APT (Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab) trial of paclitaxel-trastuzumab once per week for 12 weeks followed by trastuzumab reported excellent short-term (3-year) DFS of 98.7% in a node-negative, lower-risk HER2-positive population. Another phase II study that assessed the concomitant administration of four cycles of docetaxel-cyclophosphamide with trastuzumab followed by trastuzumab alone reported a 3-year DFS of 96.9% for women with early-stage HER2-amplified breast cancer. Given data from these phase II trials and data from the HERA (Herceptin Adjuvant Trial) trial, in which systemic therapy was given per investigator choice, paclitaxel, docetaxel-cyclophosphamide, or any of the regimens used in HERA can be considered a reasonable systemic option in combination with trastuzumab, particularly for patients who are perceived to be at increased risk for cardiotoxicity.</p>
<p><strong>Duration of Trastuzumab Therapy and Cardiac Function Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Patients should be offered 1 year total of adjuvant trastuzumab, with regular assessments of cardiac function during that period.*</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The adaptation process usually starts with a literature search to identify candidate guidelines for adaptation on a given topic. For this adaptation, however, the target guideline was identified through an informal collaboration between the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Program in Evidence-based Care and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines program, which is designed to reduce duplication of effort in oncology practice guideline development across organizations. As part of this collaboration, CCO guidelines staff made ASCO aware that CCO's comprehensive practice guideline on optimal systemic therapy for early breast cancer in women was nearing completion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of the CCO Guideline Development Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>CCO guideline recommendations were developed by a panel that included experts in medical oncology. The literature searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE that were completed for the broad systematic review spanned the period from January 2008 through March 2012; the search was updated in May 2014. Additional practice guidelines were identified from a search of the SAGE Directory of Cancer Guidelines. Details of the search strategies, the study inclusion criteria, the outcomes of interest, and the search yield are available at the CCO Web site at <a href="/web/20180712201525/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50402&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cancercare.on.ca%2ftoolbox%2fqualityguidelines%2fdiseasesite%2fbreast-ebs" title="CCO Web site">https://www.cancercare.on.ca/toolbox/qualityguidelines/diseasesite/breast-ebs</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712201525im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods and Results of ASCO Updated Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>A search for new evidence was conducted by ASCO guidelines staff to identify relevant randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published since the CCO guideline was completed. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 2014 to July 2015 by following the strategies described in the CCO guideline. The search was restricted to articles published in English and to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. The CCO guideline inclusion criteria were applied to a review of the literature search results. The updated search and review were guided by the signals approach, which is designed to identify only new, potentially practice-changing data&mdash;signals that might translate into revised practice recommendations. This approach relied on targeted routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO Guideline Panel members to help identify potential signals. Panel members also provided additional relevant references from personal files. The Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides additional information about the signals approach. The updated search yielded 4,018 records.</p></div></p>

Detailed results of the scoring for these assessments are available in the Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Overall, the more comprehensive CCO guideline scored 98% in rigor of guideline development.</p>
<p>The content review is completed by an Adaptation Panel convened by ASCO that includes multidisciplinary representation. The Panel members are asked to complete an eight item Guideline Endorsement Content Review Form (see Figure 2 in the Methodology Supplement) that assesses the perceived clarity and clinical utility of the recommendations, and the degree to which the recommendations are consistent with the content reviewers' interpretation of the available data on the topic in question. This form was adapted by ASCO from the Cancer Care Ontario Program in Evidence-based Care Practitioner Feedback instrument.</p>
<p>The Adaptation Panel is led by two Co-Chairs who have the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline adaptation. Recommendations from the source guidelines are extracted into a summary matrix.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Guideline Development Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>A working group composed of six medical oncologists and a methodologist drafted guideline recommendations. These draft recommendations were subsequently circulated to the Early Breast Cancer Systemic Therapy Consensus Panel, which included the working group members and 14 additional medical oncologists from Ontario as part of a modified Delphi consensus development technique for which consensus was defined as 80% agreement and no strong disagreement. By using a 5-point point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree), Consensus Panel members from CCO rated the draft recommendations in advance of a consensus meeting held in November 2012. Selected recommendations for which consensus was not achieved were discussed and voted on at the 2012 consensus meeting.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guideline Adaptation Process</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline adaptation was informed by the ADAPTE methodology, which was used as an alternative to de novo guideline development. Adaptation of guidelines is considered by ASCO in selected circumstances, when one or more quality guidelines on the same topic from other organizations already exist. The objective of the ADAPTE process (<a href="/web/20180712201525/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50402&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.g-i-n.net%2fworking-groups%2fadaptation" title="G-I-N Web site">http://www.g-i-n.net/working-groups/adaptation</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712201525im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>) is to take advantage of existing guidelines to enhance efficient production, reduce duplication, and promote the local uptake of quality guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>ASCO's adaptation process typically begins with a literature search to identify candidate guidelines for adaptation. Adapted guideline manuscripts are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC). The review includes two parts: methodologic review and content review. The methodologic review is completed by a member of the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Methodology Subcommittee and/or by ASCO senior guideline staff. The content review is completed by an ad hoc panel convened by ASCO that includes representatives of several disciplines. Further details of the methods used for the development of this guideline adaptation are reported in Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results of Guideline Search and ASCO Topic Priority-Setting Process</span></strong></p>
<p>On the basis of a preliminary content review of the draft CCO guideline by two members of ASCO's Breast Cancer Advisory Group, the CCO recommendations on the selection of optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimens and the selection of adjuvant targeted therapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers were selected as a possible adaptation opportunity. The Advisory Group subsequently ranked the adaptation of the CCO recommendations on chemotherapy and targeted therapy as one of its top three priorities for breast cancer guideline development.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>On the basis of a formal content review of the CCO guideline, the ASCO Panel agreed that, in general, the recommendations were clear and thorough, were based on the most relevant scientific evidence, and presented options that will be acceptable to patients. However, for some topics, the ASCO Panel formulated a set of adapted recommendations on the basis of local context and practice beliefs of the ad hoc panel members and new information.</p></div></p>

However, those with triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&ndash;positive breast cancer seem to derive the greatest proportional benefit from systemic chemotherapy and biologic therapy.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy regimens should take into account baseline recurrence risk, toxicities, likelihood of benefit, and host factors such as comorbidities. </li>
    <li>In the Breast Cancer International Research Group (BCIRG) 006 (Combination Chemotherapy with or without Trastuzumab in Treating Women with Breast Cancer) trial, lower rates of cardiotoxicity were observed with docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab than with doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel-trastuzumab. These data support preferential use of docetaxel-carboplatin-trastuzumab, particularly for patients who might be at greater risk for cardiac dysfunction, on the basis of factors such as older age, low baseline ejection fraction, and pre-existing hypertension. Another option for patients with lower-risk node-negative disease who might have a higher risk for cardiotoxicity is trastuzumab-paclitaxel once per week followed by trastuzumab alone on the basis of a single-arm phase II trial in which rates of symptomatic heart failure were low and the observed asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction improved with trastuzumab interruption and/or cessation. </li>
