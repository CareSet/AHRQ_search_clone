<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis and Symptoms of Menopause</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests diagnosing menopause based on the clinical criteria of the menstrual cycle. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>If establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary for patient management in women having undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or presenting with a menstrual history that is inadequate to ascertain menopausal status, the Task Force suggests making a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and, when indicated, laboratory testing that includes replicate measures of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and serum estradiol. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Considerations for All Menopausal Women</span></strong></p>
<p>When women present during the menopausal transition, the Task Force suggests using this opportunity to address bone health, smoking cessation, alcohol use, cardiovascular risk assessment and management, and cancer screening and prevention. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hormone Therapy for Menopausal Symptom Relief</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Estrogen and Progestogen Therapy</strong></p>
<p>For menopausal women &lt;60 years of age or &lt;10 years past menopause with bothersome VMS (with or without additional climacteric symptoms) who do not have contraindications or excess cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and are willing to take menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), the Task Force suggests initiating estrogen therapy (ET) for those without a uterus and estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) for those with a uterus. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Cardiovascular Risk</em></p>
<p>For women &lt;age 60 or &lt;10 years past menopause onset considering MHT for menopausal symptom relief, the Task Force suggests evaluating the baseline risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and taking this risk into consideration when advising for or against MHT and when selecting type, dose, and route of administration. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For women at high risk of CVD, the Task Force suggests initiating nonhormonal therapies to alleviate bothersome VMS (with or without climacteric symptoms) over MHT. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For women with moderate risk of CVD, the Task Force suggests transdermal estradiol as first-line treatment, alone for women without a uterus or combined with micronized progesterone (or another progestogen that does not adversely modify metabolic parameters) for women with a uterus, because these preparations have less untoward effect on blood pressure, triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Venous Thromboembolic Events</em></p>
<p>For women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) who request MHT, the Task Force recommends a nonoral route of ET at the lowest effective dose, if not contraindicated (<strong>1|++OO</strong>); for women with a uterus, the Task Force recommends a progestogen (for example, progesterone and <span>dydrogesterone</span>) that is neutral on coagulation parameters. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Breast Cancer</em></p>
<p>For women considering MHT for menopausal symptom relief, the Task Force suggests evaluating the baseline risk of breast cancer and taking this risk into consideration when advising for or against MHT and when selecting type, dose, and route of administration. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For women at high or intermediate risk of breast cancer considering MHT for menopausal symptom relief, the Task Force suggests nonhormonal therapies over MHT to alleviate bothersome VMS. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Tailoring MHT</em></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Custom-compounded Hormones</em></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends using MHT preparations approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and comparable regulating bodies outside the United States and recommend against the use of custom-compounded hormones. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Conjugated Equine Estrogens with Bazedoxifene</strong></p>
<p>For symptomatic postmenopausal women with a uterus and without contraindications, the Task Force suggests the combination of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)/bazedoxifene (BZA) (where available) as an option for relief of VMS and prevention of bone loss. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Tibolone</strong></p>
<p>For women with bothersome VMS and climacteric symptoms and without contraindications, the Task Force suggests tibolone (in countries where available) as an alternative to MHT. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against adding tibolone to other forms of MHT. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against using tibolone in women with a history of breast cancer. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Management of Patients Taking Hormone Therapies</strong></p>
<p><em>Monitoring During Therapy</em></p>
<p>For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, the Task Force recommends evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, the Task Force suggests taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Stopping Considerations</em></p>
<p>For women preparing to discontinue MHT, the Task Force suggests a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs. abrupt discontinuation. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nonhormonal Therapies for VMS</span></strong></p>
<p>For postmenopausal women with mild or less bothersome hot flashes, the Task Force suggests a series of steps that do not involve medication, such as turning down the thermostat, dressing in layers, avoiding alcohol and spicy foods, and reducing obesity and stress. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Nonhormonal Prescription Therapies for VMS</strong></p>
<p>For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom MHT is contraindicated, or who choose not to take MHT, the Task Force recommends selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or gabapentin or pregabalin (if there are no contraindications). (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>For those women seeking relief of moderate to severe VMS who are not responding to or tolerating the nonhormonal prescription therapies, SSRIs/SNRIs or gabapentin or pregabalin, the Task Force suggests a trial of clonidine (if there are no contraindications). (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Over-the-Counter and Alternative Nonhormonal Therapies for VMS</strong></p>
<p>For women seeking relief of VMS with over-the-counter (OTC) or complementary medicine therapies, the Task Force suggests counseling regarding the lack of consistent evidence for benefit for botanicals, black cohosh, omega-3-fatty acids, red clover, vitamin E, and mind/body alternatives including anxiety control, acupuncture, paced breathing, and hypnosis. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Vaginal Moisturizers and Lubricants</strong></p>
<p>For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), the Task Force suggests a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, the Task Force suggests vaginal lubricants. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Vaginal Estrogen Therapies</strong></p>
<p>For women without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers who are seeking relief from symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) (including VVA) that persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, the Task Force recommends low-dose vaginal ET. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Practice Statement</em></p>
<p>In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer who present with symptomatic GSM (including VVA) that does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, the Task Force suggests a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal ET. (<strong>Ungraded best practice statement</strong>)</p>
<p>For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop symptoms of GSM (including VVA) that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, the Task Force suggests adding low-dose vaginal ET. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For women using low-dose vaginal ET, the Task Force suggests against adding a progestogen (i.e., no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). (<strong>2|+OOO</strong>)</p>
<p>For women using vaginal ET who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, the Task Force recommends prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Ospemifene</strong></p>
<p>For treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women without contraindications, the Task Force suggests a trial of ospemifene. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>For women with a history of breast cancer presenting with dyspareunia, the Task Force recommends against ospemifene. (<strong>1|+OOO</strong>)</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oral vs. Transdermal Estrogen and the Risk of Venous and Arterial Thrombotic Adverse Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Using a standardized form two reviewers independently extracted data from each study and later reconciled differences, if present. The reviewers determined the methodological quality of studies and collected descriptive, methodological and outcome data. For assessing the risk of bias, the reviewers used The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to appraise the risk of bias of the included case-control and cohort studies.</p>
<p>For dichotomized outcomes, the reviewers calculated risk ratio from comparing oral hormone replacement therapy (HRT) versus transdermal HRT in the included studies. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using binomial distribution. The reviewers then pooled the log transformed risk ratios using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models with the heterogeneity estimated from the Mantel-Haenszel model.</p>
<p>The reviewers conducted subgroup analyses based on outcome, estrogen dose and type. To measure the overall heterogeneity across the included studies, the reviewers used <em>I<sup>&sup2;</sup></em> statistic, where <em>I<sup>&sup2;</sup></em>&gt;50% suggests high heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were conducted using CMA version 2.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The overall risk of bias in the included observational studies was moderate; samples were representative in most studies together with no baseline imbalance and nearly all the studies adjusted for at least one important confounder.</p>
<p>See the systematic review for further information on the risks associated with specific outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Subgroup Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Subgroup analysis was only possible for the outcome of venous thromboembolism (VTE). There was no significant interaction between the dose of estrogen or the type of HRT (estrogen vs. combined) and the risk of VTE.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Breast Cancer in Natural Progesterone Versus Synthetic Progestins: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Using a standardized form two reviewers independently extracted data from each study and later reconciled differences, if present. The reviewers determined the methodological quality of studies using NOS and collected descriptive, methodological and outcome data.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Breast Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Based on meta-analysis of the 2 studies, natural progesterone was associated with lower breast cancer risk compared to synthetic progestin (Pooled risk ratio=0.67, [95% CI 0.55-0.81] <em>I<sup>&sup2;</sup></em>=42%).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hormonal Replacement Therapy and Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Using a standardized form two reviewers independently extracted data from each study and later reconciled differences, if present. The reviewers determined the methodological quality of studies and collected descriptive, methodological and outcome data.</p>
<p>For assessing the risk of bias, the reviewers used Cochrane tool for assessing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and NOS to appraise the risk of bias of the included case-control, cohort and comparative case series studies.</p>
<p>For dichotomized outcomes, the reviewers calculated risk ratio from comparing HRT use vs. HRT non-use in the included studies. The 95% CIs were estimated using binomial distribution. The reviewers then pooled the log transformed risk ratios using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models with the heterogeneity estimated from the Mantel-Haenszel model.</p>
<p>The reviewers conducted subgroup analyses based on estrogen type (only estrogen vs. combined estrogen), preexisting condition and type of study design. To measure the overall heterogeneity across the included studies, they used <em>I<sup>&sup2; </sup></em>statistic, where <em>I<sup>&sup2;</sup></em>&gt;50% suggests high heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were conducted using CMA version 2.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>In the randomized trials, the risk of bias was moderate to high. Randomization methods were unclear or not reported in 12 studies, 25 studies didn't report allocation concealment and blinding wasn't reported in 16 studies. The percentage lost to follow-up ranged from 0&ndash;46%. For observational studies, samples were representative in most studies together with no baseline imbalance; nearly all the studies adjusted for at least one important confounder and most of the studies didn't report the adequacy of follow up.</p>
<p>In subgroup analysis (limited to RCTs), there was no significant interaction based on hormone type (estrogen vs. combined) and based on whether patients had a pre-existing heart disease (P &gt;0.05 for both).</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Participants</span></strong></p>
<p>The Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause Task Force included six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, all appointed by The Endocrine Society.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force developed this evidenced-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Process</span></strong></p>
<p>Multiple e-mail communications, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting determined consensus. Committees of The Endocrine Society, representatives from endorsing societies, and members of The Endocrine Society reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines. The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>In postmenopausal women, estrogen therapy (ET) improves menopause-associated (climacteric) symptoms (e.g., vasomotor symptoms [VMS], genitourinary symptoms, sleep disturbance, menopause-associated anxiety and depressive symptoms, and arthralgias). ET also reduces menopause-related bone loss, lowers the risk of fragility fractures in older women, and reduces the incidence of self-reported diabetes. In addition, combined estrogen plus progestogen therapy [EPT] reduced the risk of colorectal cancer and, in cumulative follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), endometrial cancer.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>See Table 4 in the original guideline document for specific cautions for the use of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for treatment of menopausal symptoms. </li>
    <li>Side effects of MHT can include abdominal/pelvic pain, mastalgia, metrorrhagia, weight gain, mood changes and blood pressure changes. </li>
    <li>Preliminary evidence suggests a possible increase in risk of bone fracture with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). </li>
    <li>Side effects of vaginal estrogens include vulvovaginal candidiasis and, with higher dosing and systemic absorption, vaginal bleeding and breast pain. Adverse effects include potential transfer to partner via penile or oral absorption and, with vaginal creams, residue on undergarments. </li>
    <li>The most common adverse effect of ospemifene was vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (7.2% of women taking ospemifene compared with 2% taking placebo). </li>
    <li>Although an osteoporosis trial found a 2-fold risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with bazedoxifene (BZA) 20-mg therapy alone, there was no additive effect on VTE when BZA was combined with conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), although adequately powered studies are necessary. </li>
    <li>Gabapentin and pregabalin may increase suicidal thoughts and behaviors, cause drowsiness or dizziness, and impair balance and coordination. Pregabalin may impair memory and concentration. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clonidine is contraindicated in patients with low blood pressure and may cause light headedness, hypotension, headache, and constipation; sudden cessation of treatment can be associated with significant increments in blood pressure. </li>
    <li>See Table 4 in the original guideline document for specific cautions for the use of systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for treatment of menopausal symptoms. </li>
    <li>Hypersensitivity or prior adverse drug reactions to nonhormonal prescription therapies represent contraindications. For the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), prior neuroleptic syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors are also contraindications. SSRI/SNRIs should be used with caution in patients with bipolar disease, uncontrolled seizures, hepatic or renal insufficiency, uncontrolled hyponatremia, concurrent use of other SSRI/SNRIs, or poorly controlled hypertension. These agents uncommonly induce suicidal thoughts within the first few months of treatment. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-of-interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before the members are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict-of-interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (e.g., stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through the Endocrine Society office.</p>
