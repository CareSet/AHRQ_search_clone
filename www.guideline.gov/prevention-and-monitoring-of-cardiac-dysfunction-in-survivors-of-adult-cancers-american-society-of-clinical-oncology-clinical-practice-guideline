<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which patients with cancer are at increased risk for developing cardiac dysfunction?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: It is recommended that patients with cancer who meet any of the following criteria should be considered at increased risk for developing cardiac dysfunction.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Treatment that includes any of the following:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>High-dose anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin &ge;250 mg/m&sup2;, epirubicin &ge;600 mg/m&sup2;) </li>
        <li>High-dose radiation therapy (RT) (&ge;30 Gy) where the heart is in the treatment field </li>
        <li>Lower-dose anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m&sup2;, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m&sup2;) in combination with lower-dose RT (&lt;30 Gy) where the heart is in the treatment field </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin &lt;250mg/m&sup2;, epirubicin &lt;600mg/m&sup2;) or trastuzumab alone, and presence of any of the following risk factors:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Multiple cardiovascular risk factors (&ge; two risk factors), including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity, during or after completion of therapy </li>
        <li>Older age (&ge;60 years) at cancer treatment </li>
        <li>Compromised cardiac function (e.g., borderline low left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] [50% to 55%], history of myocardial infarction, &ge; moderate valvular heart disease) at any time before or during treatment </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m&sup2;, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m&sup2;) followed by trastuzumab (sequential therapy) </li>
</ul>
<p>(Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: No recommendation can be made on the risk of cardiac dysfunction in patients with cancer with any of the following treatment exposures:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Lower-dose anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m&sup2;, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m&sup2;) or trastuzumab alone and no additional risk factors (as defined in Recommendation 1.1) </li>
    <li>Lower-dose RT (&lt;30 Gy) where the heart is in the treatment field and no additional cardiotoxic therapeutic exposures or risk factors (as defined in Recommendation 1.1) </li>
    <li>Kinase inhibitors (KIs) </li>
</ul>
<p>(Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which preventative strategies minimize risk before initiation of therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Avoid or minimize the use of potentially cardiotoxic therapies if established alternatives exist that would not compromise cancer-specific outcomes (Type: consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: Clinicians should perform a comprehensive assessment in patients with cancer that includes a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking), and an echocardiogram before initiation of potentially cardiotoxic therapies (Type: evidence and consensus based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which preventive strategies are effective in minimizing risk during the administration of potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: Clinicians should screen for and actively manage modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) in all patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic treatments (Type: informal consensus and evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: Clinicians may incorporate a number of strategies, including use of the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane, continuous infusion, or liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, for prevention of cardiotoxicity in patients planning to receive high-dose anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin &ge;250 mg/m&sup2;, epirubicin &ge;600 mg/m&sup2;) (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: For patients who require mediastinal RT that might impact cardiac function, clinicians should select lower radiation doses when clinically appropriate and use more precise or tailored radiation fields with exclusion of as much of the heart as possible. These goals can be accomplished through use of advanced techniques including the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Deep-inspiration breath holding for patients with mediastinal tumors or breast cancer in which the heart might be exposed </li>
    <li>Intensity-modulated RT that varies the radiation energy while treatment is delivered to precisely contour the desired radiation distribution and avoid normal tissues </li>
</ul>
<p>(Type: evidence based and informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the preferred surveillance and monitoring approaches during treatment in patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.1</em>: Clinicians should complete a careful history and physical examination in patients who are receiving potentially cardiotoxic treatments (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.2</em>: In individuals with clinical signs or symptoms concerning for cardiac dysfunction during routine clinical assessment, the following strategy is recommended:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Echocardiogram for diagnostic workup (type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; evidence quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong) </li>
    <li>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) if echocardiogram is not available or technically feasible (e.g., poor image quality), with preference given to cardiac MRI (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate) </li>
    <li>Serum cardiac biomarkers (troponins, natriuretic peptides) or echocardiography-derived strain imaging in conjunction with routine diagnostic imaging (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate) </li>
    <li>Referral to a cardiologist based on findings (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.3</em>: Routine surveillance imaging may be offered during treatment in asymptomatic patients considered to be at increased risk (Recommendation 1.1) of developing cardiac dysfunction. In these individuals, echocardiography is the surveillance imaging modality of choice that should be offered. Frequency of surveillance should be determined by health care providers based on clinical judgment and patient circumstances (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.4</em>: No recommendations can be made regarding continuation or discontinuation of cancer therapy in individuals with evidence of cardiac dysfunction. This decision, made by the oncologist, should be informed by close collaboration with a cardiologist, fully evaluating the clinical circumstances and considering the risks and benefits of continuation of therapy responsible for the cardiac dysfunction (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.5</em>: Clinicians may use routine echocardiographic surveillance in patients with metastatic breast cancer continuing to receiving trastuzumab indefinitely. The frequency of cardiac imaging for each patient should be determined by health care providers based on clinical judgment and patient circumstances (Type: evidence based and informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the preferred surveillance and monitoring approaches after treatment in patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: Clinicians should complete a careful history and physical examination in survivors of cancer previously treated with potentially cardiotoxic therapies (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1.1</em>: In individuals with clinical signs or symptoms concerning for cardiac dysfunction, the following approaches should be offered as part of recommended care:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Echocardiogram for diagnostic workup (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong) </li>
    <li>Cardiac MRI or MUGA if echocardiogram is not available or technically feasible (e.g., poor image quality), with preference given to cardiac MRI (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate) </li>
    <li>Serum cardiac biomarkers (troponins, natriuretic peptides) (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate) </li>
    <li>Referral to a cardiologist based on findings (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2</em>: An echocardiogram may be performed between 6 and 12 months after completion of cancer-directed therapy in asymptomatic patients considered to be at increased risk (Recommendation 1.1) of cardiac dysfunction (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2.1</em>: Cardiac MRI or MUGA may be offered for surveillance in asymptomatic individuals if an echocardiogram is not available or technically feasible (e.g., poor image quality), with preference given to cardiac MRI (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.3</em>: Patients identified to have asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction during routine surveillance should be referred to a cardiologist or a health care provider with cardio-oncology expertise for further assessment and management (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.4</em>: No recommendations can be made regarding the frequency and duration of surveillance in patients at increased risk (Recommendation 1.1) who are asymptomatic and have no evidence of cardiac dysfunction on their 6- to 12-month post-treatment echocardiogram (Type: informal consensus, relative balance of benefits and harms; Evidence quality: insufficient).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.5</em>: Clinicians should regularly evaluate and manage cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity in patients previously treated with cardiotoxic cancer therapies. A heart-healthy lifestyle, including the role of diet and exercise, should be discussed as part of long-term follow-up care (Type: evidence based and consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews. A protocol for each guideline defines the parameters for a targeted literature search including relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespecified study selection criteria for identified literature. For this guideline, the MEDLINE (Ovid: 1996 through May [week 2] 2014) database was searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. An updated literature search (period: May 2014 to February 16, 2016) was conducted in PubMed to identify relevant studies that may impact the current recommendations. Reference lists from seminal articles and recent review articles were scanned for additional citations, and known updates of included evidence were obtained as available. The literature search strategy used in the MEDLINE and PubMed databases is available in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles were eligible for inclusion in this review of the evidence if they met the following criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1. Risk Categorization</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Population-based cohort studies with long-term and complete follow-up that included validated cardiovascular outcomes, treatment dose&ndash;specific information, comparison with no exposure, and multivariable regression analysis that adjusted for confounders. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2. Prevention before Initiation of Cancer-Directed Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Comparative studies that considered prevention strategies of interest. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3. Prevention during Cancer-Directed Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies that considered prevention strategies of interest, including limitation of cardiotoxic antineoplastic dose or exposure, alternative drug administration schedules, use of less cardiotoxic analogs, limitation of total radiation therapy (RT) dose, precision of RT volume to avoid heart, use of cardioprotectants, and management of modifiable risk factors. </li>
    <li>Results were reported for development of asymptomatic or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 4. Surveillance during Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies that described the incidence of cardiac dysfunction (asymptomatic or symptomatic) as a result of specific therapeutic exposures during treatment. </li>
    <li>Comparative studies that evaluated the utility and accuracy of surveillance with cardiac imaging (e.g., echocardiography, strain, tissue Doppler, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], multigated acquisition [MUGA] scan) or blood-based biomarkers for detection of cardiac dysfunction. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 5. Surveillance after Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies describing the incidence of asymptomatic or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction over time were collected to inform the frequency and duration of long-term surveillance. </li>
    <li>Comparative studies that evaluated the utility and accuracy of surveillance with cardiac imaging (e.g., echocardiography, strain, tissue Doppler, MRI, MUGA) or blood-based biomarkers for detection of cardiac dysfunction. </li>
    <li>Studies that examined the effectiveness of interventions in asymptomatic cancer survivors for prevention of symptomatic disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; published in a non-English language; or described studies that included fewer than 20 participants. Meeting abstracts not yet published in peer-reviewed journals were generally excluded for review, except when there was uniform consensus from the Expert Panel regarding their importance for the formulation of recommendations.</p></div></p>

<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were assessed for quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. Design elements, such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, and funding sources, were assessed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methodologic criteria assessed for cohort studies and before-and-after studies included type of data collection, sampling method, representativeness of participants, objective outcomes, and appropriate statistical analyses. Assessment of cross-sectional studies was informed by the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The risk of bias for all included studies is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high". Ratings are described further in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full-text review by an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff member in consultation with the co-chairs. Data were extracted by one ASCO staff member and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the co-chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, cardiology, exercise physiology, family medicine, cancer prevention, cancer survivorship, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline product, the Co-Chairs selected additional members from the Update Committee to form a Writing Group/Steering Committee to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts. The Expert Panel included representatives from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met (in person/webinar) on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs/Writing Group/Steering Committee along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p>The recommendations were informed by a systematic review (1996 to 2016) of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational studies, and clinical experience. Where evidence was lacking but there was a high level of agreement among the panel members (&gt;80% of panelists), informal consensus was used, as noted with the recommendations.</p></div></p>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href="/web/20180712201108/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50704&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.asco.org%2fpractice-guidelines" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712201108im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
<p>ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.</p>

<p>The Expert Panel was assembled in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO's) Conflict of Interest Policy Implementation for Clinical Practice Guidelines ("Policy," found at <a href="/web/20180712201108/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50704&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.asco.org%2fabout-asco%2fasco-overview%2fasco-policies%2fpolicies-and-safeguards-relationships-companies" title="ASCO Web site">http://www.asco.org/rwc</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712201108im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). All members of the panel completed ASCO's disclosure form, which requires disclosure of financial and other interests, including relationships with commercial entities that are reasonably likely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impact as a result of promulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; stock or other ownership; honoraria; consulting or advisory role; speakers' bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, expenses; and other relationships. In accordance with the Policy, the majority of the members of the panel did not disclose any relationships constituting a conflict under the Policy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Authors' Disclosures and Potential Conflicts of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of the guideline. All relationships are considered compensated. Relationships are self-held unless noted.
