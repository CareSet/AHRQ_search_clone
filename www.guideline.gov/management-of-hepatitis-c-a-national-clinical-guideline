<p>The levels of evidence (1++, 1+, 1-, 2++, 2+, 2-, 3, 4) and grades of recommendations (A&ndash;D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Testing</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical and Cost-Effective Testing for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The following groups should be tested for HCV:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Blood/tissue donors </li>
    <li>Patients on haemodialysis </li>
    <li>Healthcare professionals who intend to pursue a career in a specialty that requires them to perform exposure prone procedures </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - The following groups should be offered an HCV test:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients with an otherwise unexplained persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase </li>
    <li>People with a history of injecting drug use </li>
    <li>People who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive </li>
    <li>Recipients of blood clotting factor concentrates prior to 1987 </li>
    <li>Recipients of blood and blood components before September 1991 and organ/tissue transplants in the UK before 1992 </li>
    <li>Children whose mother is known to be infected with HCV </li>
    <li>Healthcare professionals following percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to blood which is, or is suspected to be, infected with HCV </li>
    <li>People who have received medical or dental treatment in countries where HCV is common and infection control may be poor </li>
    <li>People who have had tattoos or body piercing in circumstances where infection control procedure is, or is suspected to be, suboptimal </li>
    <li>People who have had a sexual partner or household contact who is HCV infected </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Dried blood spot testing should be considered as a convenient and cost-effective method of accessing some target populations.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - There should be consideration given to methods to raise awareness and highlight information regarding hepatitis C amongst at-risk groups and the general public. The targeting of awareness campaigns to particular audiences is recommended. Staff should have access to appropriate training.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Anyone who has a negative test but remains at risk of infection should be offered further testing on an annual basis.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Testing for HCV should be offered to migrants from countries with a medium or high prevalence of HCV.</p>
<p><strong>HCV Diagnostic Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Principles of Testing</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Diagnostic testing for HCV should be performed on serum or plasma where possible.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - HCV genotyping should be undertaken if antiviral therapy is being considered.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Following an isolated acute percutaneous exposure to blood infected, or strongly suspected of being infected, with HCV, healthcare professionals should be offered HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing at six, 12 and 24 weeks and anti-HCV testing at 12 and 24 weeks.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevention of Secondary Transmission</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Transmission Through Sexual and Household Contact</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Individuals co-infected with HIV/HCV should be advised always to practice safe sex and use condoms.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Individuals infected with HCV should be advised to avoid activities which could result in percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to their infected blood, such as the sharing of razors and toothbrushes.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission Through Injecting Drug Use</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Injecting drug users known to be infected with HCV should be given advice on how they can prevent transmission of infection to other injecting drug users.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission Between Healthcare Professionals and Patients</strong></p>
<p><em>Risk of Patient Infection</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Healthcare professionals who are aware they are HCV RNA positive should not undertake exposure-prone procedures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Individuals, including injecting drug users, diagnosed with chronic HCV should be offered integrated multidisciplinary care as it can maximise their uptake of, and retention in, services.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Patients with acute HCV infection should be referred to specialist care immediately.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children and Hepatitis C</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mother to Child Transmission</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In pregnant women knowledge of HCV RNA positive status should not influence obstetric management or standard advice regarding breast feeding.</p>
<p><strong>HCV Testing in Children and Infants</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Infants born to women who are HCV antibody positive and HCV RNA negative do not need to be tested.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In children born to women infected with HCV, an HCV antibody test should be performed at 12 months of age or older to identify the minority of children who are infected.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - In children whose mothers are co-infected with HIV, and in infants found to be HCV antibody positive after 12 months, an HCV RNA test should be performed, and if positive, confirmed on a second sample.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - If information regarding the risk of HCV infection in an individual child is required before 12 months of age, an HCV RNA test and retest can be performed after two months of age. Further testing is still required to make a definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Natural History of HCV Infection in Children</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Children infected with HCV should be monitored to identify the minority who are at risk of progressive fibrosis during childhood, and who may be candidates for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Children with Hepatitis C</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Children infected with all genotypes of hepatitis C with evidence of moderate or severe liver disease should be considered for treatment with pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Children infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 should be considered for treatment with pegylated INF and ribavirin irrespective of disease stage.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - In children with mild disease and infection with other genotypes, benefits of treatment need to be balanced against risks of side effects.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acute Hepatitis C</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Natural History</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients with acute HCV infection require clinical and laboratory monitoring (looking for spontaneous viral clearance) for the initial three months following diagnosis as they will often have a self limiting illness.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Patients with Acute Hepatitis C</strong></p>
<p><em>Timing of Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Treatment should start between three and six months after diagnosis of acute hepatitis C, if the infection has not resolved spontaneously.</p>
<p><em>Choice and Duration of Treatment</em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Patients with acute HCV infection should be treated with IFN therapy if the infection does not resolve spontaneously.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients can be treated with either pegylated IFN or non-pegylated IFN.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients with acute HCV infection should be treated with IFN therapy for 24 weeks irrespective of genotype.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Liver Disease</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fibrosis Markers</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Biochemical markers should not be used as an alternative to liver biopsy for staging of intermediate grades of fibrosis.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Biochemical tests may be used as an alternative to liver biopsy to diagnose cirrhosis or to direct screening for complications of fibrosis.</p>
<p><strong>Liver Biopsy</strong></p>
<p><em>When to Biopsy</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Liver biopsy should be performed if there is concern about additional causes of liver disease.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Repeat liver biopsies should be considered in patients with mild disease who remain untreated, if progression of liver fibrosis would influence the decision to opt for antiviral therapy.</p>
<p><em>Biopsy and Genotype</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Liver biopsy should not be considered an essential test prior to using antiviral therapy, especially in patients with genotype 2 and 3 disease.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Progression of Untreated Disease</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Age, Gender and Ethnicity</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When estimating the likely rate of progression of liver disease age at infection, gender and ethnicity should be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Tobacco Smoking</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) should be advised that smoking tobacco can accelerate progression of liver disease.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Patients with CHC should be advised that drinking alcohol (even in moderation) can accelerate progression of liver disease.</p>
<p><strong>Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When defining persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase (PNALT) serum ALT measurement should be undertaken every two to three months to ensure that flares in ALT are not missed.</p>
<p><strong>HIV Co-Infection</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - The increased rate of progression to decompensated liver disease in patients with HCV and HIV co-infection should prompt early consideration of antiviral therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Co-Infection with Hepatitis A or B Viruses</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Vaccination against hepatitis A and B should be considered for patients infected with hepatitis C.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - When estimating the likely rate of progression of liver disease as a result of hepatitis C infection, active or previous hepatitis B virus infection should be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Status</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Modest iron loading does not justify specific intervention prior to antiviral therapy as it is unlikely to be of clinical importance.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients with significant iron retention require further investigation for additional conditions known to result in iron overload.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C</span></strong></p>

<p><em>Anaemia and Neutropenia</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Erythropoietin (EPO) should be considered in CHC patients receiving pegylated IFN and ribavirin therapy who develop anaemia, to prevent curtailment or dose reduction of ribavirin.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - For patients receiving a protease inhibitor in combination with pegylated IFN and ribavirin therapy, consider ribavirin dose reduction as an alternative to the addition of EPO for controlling anaemia.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered on a case-by-case basis for patients who develop significant neutropenia while receiving treatment with pegylated IFN and ribavirin for CHC infection, to prevent curtailment or dose reduction of pegylated IFN.</p>
<p><em>Depression</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - All patients receiving pegylated IFN and ribavirin should be monitored for signs of depression before, during and immediately post-treatment.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Patients treated with pegylated IFN and ribavirin who experience depression should be considered for treatment with antidepressants and for referral to a specialist, if necessary.</p>
<p><em>Skin Reactions</em></p>

<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients with CHC and hypertension or diabetes should have an ophthalmic examination prior to commencing treatment, paying particular attention to cotton wool spots and retinal haemorrhage.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Any patient reporting visual disturbance during treatment should be examined further by an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - IFN should be discontinued in any patient with visual disturbance until it has resolved or an ophthalmologist has confirmed there is no retinal injury.</p>
<p><em>Alopecia</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Patients should be advised that treatment related hair loss is reversible on cessation of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Relapse or Failed Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>IFN and Ribavirin</em></p>

Databases searched include Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. The year range covered was 2006-2012. Internet searches were carried out on various websites including the US National Guideline Clearinghouse. The main searches were supplemented by material identified by individual members of the development group. Each of the selected papers was evaluated by one member of the group and one SIGN staff member using standard SIGN methodological checklists before conclusions were considered as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search for Patient Issues</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the guideline development process, a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist conducted a literature search for qualitative and quantitative studies that addressed patient issues of relevance to early management of patients with hepatitis C. Databases searched include Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, and the results were summarised and presented to the guideline development group.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Once papers have been selected as potential sources of evidence, the methodology used in each study is assessed to ensure its validity. The result of this assessment will affect the level of evidence allocated to the paper, which will in turn influence the grade of recommendation that it supports.</p>
<p>The methodological assessment is based on a number of key questions that focus on those aspects of the study design that research has shown to have a significant influence on the validity of the results reported and conclusions drawn. These key questions differ between study types, and a range of checklists is used to bring a degree of consistency to the assessment process. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has based its assessments on the MERGE (Method for Evaluating Research and Guideline Evidence) checklists developed by the New South Wales Department of Health, which have been subjected to wide consultation and evaluation. These checklists were subjected to detailed evaluation and adaptation to meet SIGN's requirements for a balance between methodological rigour and practicality of use.</p>
<p>The assessment process inevitably involves a degree of subjective judgement. The extent to which a study meets a particular criterion (e.g., an acceptable level of loss to follow up) and, more importantly, the likely impact of this on the reported results from the study will depend on the clinical context. To minimise any potential bias resulting from this, each study must be evaluated independently by at least two group members. Any differences in assessment should then be discussed by the full group. Where differences cannot be resolved, an independent reviewer or an experienced member of SIGN executive staff will arbitrate to reach an agreed quality assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables are compiled by SIGN executive staff based on the quality assessments of individual studies provided by guideline development group members. The tables summarise all the validated studies identified from the systematic literature review relating to each key question. They are presented in a standard format to make it easier to compare results across studies, and will present separately the evidence for each outcome measure used in the published studies. These evidence tables form an essential part of the guideline development record and ensure that the basis of the guideline development group's recommendations is transparent.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Synthesising the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Guideline recommendations are graded to differentiate between those based on strong evidence and those based on weak evidence. This judgement is made on the basis of an (objective) assessment of the design and quality of each study and a (perhaps more subjective) judgement on the consistency, clinical relevance and external validity of the whole body of evidence. The aim is to produce a recommendation that is evidence-based, but which is relevant to the way in which health care is delivered in Scotland and is therefore implementable.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the grading does not relate to the importance of the recommendation, but to the strength of the supporting evidence and, in particular, to the predictive power of the study designs from which that data was obtained. Thus, the grading assigned to a recommendation indicates to users the likelihood that, if that recommendation is implemented, the predicted outcome will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Considered Judgement</strong></p>
<p>It is rare for the evidence to show clearly and unambiguously what course of action should be recommended for any given question. Consequently, it is not always clear to those who were not involved in the decision making process how guideline developers were able to arrive at their recommendations, given the evidence they had to base them on. In order to address this problem, SIGN has introduced the concept of considered judgement.</p>
<p>Each guideline group considers the following factors:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quantity, quality, and consistency of evidence </li>
    <li>External validity (generalisability) of studies </li>
    <li>Directness of application to the target population for the guideline </li>
    <li>Any evidence of potential harms associated with implementation of a recommendation </li>
    <li>Clinical impact (i.e., the extent of the impact on the target patient population, and the resources needed to treat them in accordance with the recommendation) </li>
    <li>Whether, and to what extent, any equality groups may be particularly advantaged or disadvantaged by the recommendations made </li>
    <li>Implementability (i.e., how practical it would be for the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland to implement the recommendation) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then the group is asked to summarise its view on all of these issues, both the quality of the evidence and its potential impact, before making a graded recommendation. This summary should be succinct, and taken together with its views of the level of evidence represent the first draft of the text that will appear in the guideline immediately before a graded recommendation.</p>
<p>Additional detail about SIGN's process for formulating guideline recommendations is provided in Section 7 of the companion document titled "SIGN 50: A Guideline Developers' Handbook." (Edinburgh [Scotland]: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Clinical and Cost-Effective Testing for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</strong></p>
<p>Controlled trials or cohort studies to gauge the cost effectiveness of offering an HCV test to different population groups have not been undertaken. Limited evidence from economic modeling work, indicates that offering an HCV test to former injecting drug users (IDU) in drug treatment and perhaps other settings would convey cost-effective clinical benefits. Former IDU are more likely to have a higher prevalence of HCV and comply with therapy than current IDU. Models of best practice for the identification and testing of former IDU have not been developed and evaluated. Expert opinion suggests that general practices, particularly those that serve areas with a high prevalence of drug use, may constitute environments where focused, well supported testing initiatives might be successful. Prisons may also offer similar opportunities. Targeted and generalised HCV awareness/testing campaigns have been conducted but no evaluations of their success in encouraging people (including former IDU) at high risk of HCV to engage with services have been reported.</p>
<p>In populations where the prevalence of HCV is low (e.g., genitourinary medicine clinic attendees), economic modelling indicates that universal testing does not convey cost-effective clinical benefit.</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Peer Review</strong></p>
<p>All SIGN guidelines are reviewed in draft form by independent expert referees, who are asked to comment primarily on the comprehensiveness and accuracy of interpretation of the evidence base supporting the recommendations in the guideline. A number of general practitioners (GPs) and other primary care practitioners also provide comments on the guideline from the primary care perspective, concentrating particularly on the clarity of the recommendations and their assessment of the usefulness of the guideline as a working tool for the primary care team. The draft is also sent to at least two lay reviewers in order to obtain comments from the patient's perspective.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all reviewers are invited to comment as individuals, not as representatives of any particular organisation or group. Corporate interests, whether commercial, professional, or societal have an opportunity to make representations at the national meeting stage where they can send representatives to the meeting or provide comment on the draft produced for that meeting. Peer reviewers are asked to complete a declaration of interests form.</p>
<p>The comments received from peer reviewers and others are carefully tabulated and discussed with the Chair and with the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Each point must be addressed and any changes to the guideline as a result noted or, if no change is made, the reasons for this recorded.</p>
<p>As a final quality control check prior to publication, the guideline and the summary of peer reviewers' comments are reviewed by the SIGN Editorial Group for that guideline to ensure that each point has been addressed adequately and that any risk of bias in the GDG process as a whole has been minimised. Each member of the guideline development group is then asked formally to approve the final guideline for publication.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Qualifying Statements</a></h3>
                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. Adherence to guideline recommendations will not ensure a successful outcome in every case, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgement must be made by the appropriate healthcare professional(s) responsible for clinical decisions regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan. This judgement should only be arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment choices available. It is, however, advised that significant departures from the national guideline or any local guidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. </li>
    <li>The remit encompasses prevention of secondary transmission of the virus but specifically excludes primary prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Primary prevention of hepatitis C infection is an important public health concern but is outwith the remit of this guideline. The principles and evidence for the prevention of blood borne viruses are generalisable and while reviewing this large body of evidence would have been beyond the capacity of the guideline development group, reviewing the HCV evidence alone would have produced a distorted view. </li>
    <li>Recommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations may be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product licence. This is known as 'off label' use.
    <p>Medicines may be prescribed off label in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>For an indication not specified within the marketing authorisation </li>
        <li>For administration via a different route </li>
        <li>For administration of a different dose </li>
        <li>For a different patient population </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans.</p>
    <p>Generally the off label use of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience.</p>
    <p>"Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescribers' professional responsibility and potential liability."</p>
    <p>The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that when prescribing a medicine off-label, doctors should:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient's needs than an authorised alternative (if one exists) </li>
        <li>Be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicines to show its safety and efficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources </li>
        <li>Record in the patient's clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice, the reasons for the choice </li>
        <li>Take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient's care, including the monitoring the effects of the medicine </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own professional prescribing standards.</p>
    <p>Prior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the current version of the British National Formulary (BNF). The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional code of ethics of their statutory bodies and the prescribing practices of their employers.</p>
    </li>
