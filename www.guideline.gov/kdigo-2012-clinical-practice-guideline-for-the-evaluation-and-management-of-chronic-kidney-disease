<p><strong>Evaluation of CKD</strong></p>
<p><em>Evaluation of Chronicity</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In people with GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3a&ndash;G5) or markers of kidney damage, review past history and previous measurements to determine duration of kidney disease. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>)
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>If duration is &gt;3 months, CKD is confirmed. Follow recommendations for CKD. </li>
        <li>If duration is not &gt;3 months or unclear, CKD is <strong>not</strong> confirmed. Patients may have CKD or acute kidney diseases (including acute kidney injury [AKI]) or both and tests should be repeated accordingly. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Evaluation of Cause</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evaluate the clinical context, including personal and family history, social and environmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and pathologic diagnosis to determine the causes of kidney disease. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Evaluation of GFR</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Work Group recommends using serum creatinine and a GFR estimating equation for initial assessment. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests using additional tests (such as cystatin C or a clearance measurement) for confirmatory testing in specific circumstances when estimated GFR (eGFR) based on serum creatinine is less accurate. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that clinicians (<strong>1B</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Use a GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum creatinine (eGFR<sub>creat</sub>) rather than relying on the serum creatinine concentration alone. </li>
        <li>Understand clinical settings in which eGFR<sub>creat</sub> is less accurate. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that clinical laboratories should (<strong>1B</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Measure serum creatinine using a specific assay with calibration traceable to the international standard reference materials and minimal bias compared to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) reference methodology. </li>
        <li>Report eGFR<sub>creat</sub> in addition to the serum creatinine concentration in adults and specify the equation used whenever reporting eGFR<sub>creat</sub>. </li>
        <li>Report eGFR<sub>creat</sub> in adults using the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI) creatinine equation. An alternative creatinine-based GFR estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown to improve accuracy of GFR estimates compared to the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When reporting serum creatinine:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The Work Group recommends that serum creatinine concentration be reported and rounded to the nearest whole number when expressed as standard international units (&micro;mol/l) and rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/dl). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When reporting eGFR<sub>creat</sub>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The Work Group recommends that eGFR<sub>creat</sub> should be reported and rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area of 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in adults using the units ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. </li>
        <li>The Work Group recommends eGFR<sub>creat</sub> levels less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> should be reported as "decreased." </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests measuring cystatin C in adults with eGFR<sub>creat</sub> 45&ndash;59 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> who do not have markers of kidney damage if confirmation of CKD is required. (<strong>2C</strong>)
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>If eGFR from cystatin C (eGFR<sub>cys</sub>)/eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub> is also &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the diagnosis of CKD is confirmed. </li>
        <li>If eGFR<sub>cys</sub>/eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub> is &ge;60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the diagnosis of CKD is not confirmed. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If cystatin C is measured, the Work Group suggests that health professionals (<strong>2C</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Use a GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum cystatin C rather than relying on the serum cystatin C concentration alone. </li>
        <li>Understand clinical settings in which eGFR<sub>cys</sub> and eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub> are less accurate. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that clinical laboratories that measure cystatin C should (<strong>1B</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Measure serum cystatin C using an assay with calibration traceable to the international standard reference material. </li>
        <li>Report eGFR from serum cystatin C in addition to the serum cystatin C concentration in adults and specify the equation used whenever reporting eGFR<sub>cys</sub> and eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub>. </li>
        <li>Report eGFR<sub>cys</sub> and eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub> in adults using the 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C and 2012 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equations, respectively, or alternative cystatin C-based GFR estimating equations if they have been shown to improve accuracy of GFR estimates compared to the 2012 CKD-EPI cystatin C and 2012 CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equations. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When reporting serum cystatin C:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The Work Group recommends reporting serum cystatin C concentration rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/l). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>When reporting eGFR<sub>cys</sub> and eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The Work Group recommends that eGFR<sub>cys</sub> and eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub> be reported and rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area of 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in adults using the units ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. </li>
        <li>The Work Group recommends eGFR<sub>cys</sub> and eGFR<sub>creat-cys</sub> levels less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> should be reported as "decreased." </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests measuring GFR using an exogenous filtration marker under circumstances where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact on treatment decisions. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Evaluation of Albuminuria</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Work Group suggests using the following measurements for initial testing of proteinuria (in descending order of preference, in all cases an early morning urine sample is preferred) (<strong>2B</strong>):
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
        <li>Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) </li>
        <li>Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) </li>
        <li>Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading </li>
        <li>Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that clinical laboratories report ACR and PCR in untimed urine samples in addition to albumin concentration or proteinuria concentrations rather than the concentrations alone. (<strong>1B</strong>)
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The term microalbuminuria should no longer be used by laboratories. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Clinicians need to understand settings that may affect interpretation of measurements of albuminuria and order confirmatory tests as indicated (<strong>Not Graded</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to creatinine wherever possible. </li>
        <li>Confirm ACR &ge;30 mg/g (&ge;3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine sample with a subsequent early morning urine sample. </li>
        <li>If a more accurate estimate of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure albumin excretion rate (AER) or total protein excretion rate (PER) in a timed urine sample. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If significant non-albumin proteinuria is suspected, use assays for specific urine proteins (e.g., &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-microglobulin, monoclonal heavy or light chains [known in some countries as "Bence Jones" proteins]). (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definition, Identification, and Prediction of CKD Progression</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Definition and Identification of CKD Progression</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Assess GFR and albuminuria at least annually in people with CKD. Assess GFR and albuminuria more often for individuals at higher risk of progression, and/or where measurement will impact therapeutic decisions (see Figure 17 in the original guideline document). (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>Recognize that small fluctuations in GFR are common and are not necessarily indicative of progression. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>Define CKD progression based on one or more of the following (<strong>Not Graded</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Decline in GFR category (&ge;90 [G1], 60&ndash;89 [G2], 45&ndash;59 [G3a], 30&ndash;44 [G3b], 15&ndash;29 [G4], &lt;15 [G5] ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). A certain drop in eGFR is defined as a drop in GFR category accompanied by a 25% or greater drop in eGFR from baseline. </li>

(<strong>2D</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-I) be used in diabetic adults with CKD and urine albumin excretion 30&ndash;300 mg/24 hours (or equivalent*). (<strong>2D</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that an ARB or ACE-I be used in both diabetic and non-diabetic adults with CKD and urine albumin excretion &gt;300 mg/24 hours (or equivalent*). (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend combining an ACE-I with ARBs to prevent progression of CKD. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that in children with CKD, BP-lowering treatment is started when BP is consistently above the 90th percentile for age, sex, and height. (<strong>1C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that in children with CKD (particularly those with proteinuria), BP is lowered to consistently achieve systolic and diastolic readings less than or equal to the 50th percentile for age, sex, and height, unless achieving these targets is limited by signs or symptoms of hypotension. (<strong>2D</strong>) </li>

</ul>
<p><em>Glycemic Control</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Work Group recommends a target hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) of ~7.0% (53 mmol/mol) to prevent or delay progression of the microvascular complications of diabetes, including diabetic kidney disease. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends not treating to an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &lt;7.0% (&lt;53 mmol/mol) in patients at risk of hypoglycemia. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that target HbA<sub>1c</sub> be extended above 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) in individuals with comorbidities or limited life expectancy and risk of hypoglycemia. (<strong>2C</strong>) </li>
    <li>In people with CKD and diabetes, glycemic control should be part of a multifactorial intervention strategy addressing blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk, promoting the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade, statins, and antiplatelet therapy where clinically indicated.

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CKD Metabolic Bone Disease Including Laboratory Abnormalities</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

(<strong>1C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests not to perform bone mineral density testing routinely in those with eGFR &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3b&ndash;G5), as information may be misleading or unhelpful. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In people with GFR &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3b&ndash;G5), the Work Group suggests maintaining serum phosphate concentrations in the normal range according to local laboratory reference values. (<strong>2C</strong>) </li>
    <li>In people with GFR &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G3b&ndash;G5) the optimal PTH level is not known. The Work Group suggests that people with levels of intact PTH above the upper normal limit of the assay are first evaluated for hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and vitamin D deficiency. (<strong>2C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Vitamin D Supplementation and Bisphosphonates in People with CKD</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    <li>The Work Group recommends that all people with CKD be considered at increased risk for CVD. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group recommends that the level of care for ischemic heart disease offered to people with CKD should not be prejudiced by their CKD. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that adults with CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events be offered treatment with antiplatelet agents unless there is an increased bleeding risk that needs to be balanced against the possible cardiovascular benefits. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The Work Group suggests that the level of care for heart failure offered to people with CKD should be the same as is offered to those without CKD. (<strong>2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In people with CKD and heart failure, any escalation in therapy and/or clinical deterioration should prompt monitoring of eGFR and serum potassium concentration. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>

<p><strong>Referral to Specialist Services</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Work Group recommends referral to specialist kidney care services for people with CKD in the following circumstances (<strong>1B</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>AKI or abrupt sustained fall in GFR </li>
        <li>GFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR categories G4&ndash;G5)* </li>
        <li>A consistent finding of significant albuminuria (ACR &ge;300 mg/g [&ge;30 mg/mmol] or AER &ge;300 mg/24 hours, approximately equivalent to PCR &ge;500 mg/g [&ge;50 mg/mmol] or PER &ge;500 mg/24 hours) </li>

</ul>
<p>See Figure 21 in the original guideline document for information on referral decision making by GFR and albuminuria.</p>
<p class="Note">*If this is a stable isolated finding, formal referral (i.e., formal consultation and ongoing care management) may not be necessary and advice from specialist services may be all that is required to facilitate best care for the patients. This will be health-care system dependent.</p>
<p class="Note">&dagger;The aim is to avoid late referral, defined here as referral to specialist services less than 1 year before start of RRT.</p>
<p><strong>Care of the Patient with Progressive CKD</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Work Group suggests that people with progressive CKD should be managed in a multidisciplinary care setting. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The multidisciplinary team should include or have access to dietary counseling, education and counseling about different RRT modalities, transplant options, vascular access surgery, and ethical, psychological, and social care. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timing the Initiation of RRT</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Work Group suggests that dialysis be initiated when one or more of the following are present: symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure (serositis, acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, pruritus); inability to control volume status or blood pressure; a progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention; or cognitive impairment. This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (<strong>2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Living donor preemptive renal transplantation in adults should be considered when the GFR is &lt;20 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and there is evidence of progressive and irreversible CKD over the preceding 6&ndash;12 months. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure and Process of Comprehensive Conservative Management</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Conservative management should be an option in people who choose not to pursue RRT and this should be supported by a comprehensive management program. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>All CKD programs and care providers should be able to deliver advance care planning for people with a recognized need for end-of-life care, including those people undergoing conservative kidney care. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>Coordinated end-of-life care should be available to people and families through either primary care or specialist care as local circumstances dictate. (<strong>Not Graded</strong>) </li>
    <li>The comprehensive conservative management program should include protocols for symptom and pain management, psychological care, spiritual care, and culturally sensitive care for the dying patient and their family (whether at home, in a hospice or a hospital setting), followed by the provision of culturally appropriate bereavement support.

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Searches and Article Selection for Evidence Review Topics</strong></p>
<p>Search strategies were developed by the Evidence Review Team (ERT), with input from the Work Group, for each topic of interest (whether treatment or non-treatment topics). The ERT performed literature searches and conducted abstract and article screening. The ERT also coordinated the methodological and analytic processes, data extraction, and summarizing of the evidence. Before initiating the ERT's own <em>de novo</em> systematic review, the ERT searched for existing systematic reviews that could be used. The searches and search terms are provided in Supplemental Table 1 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and the search dates and yields for all topics are presented in Table 38 of the original guideline document. The search was updated through June 2011 and supplemented by articles identified by Work Group members through November 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Outcomes of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The Work Group selected outcomes of interest on the basis of their importance for informing clinical decision making. Importance of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was considered to be critical; the importance of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and categorical or continuous measures of kidney function was considered to be high; and the importance of quality of life (QOL), blood pressure (BP), gout attacks, and proteinuria was considered to be moderate.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Approach</strong></p>
<p>Although the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive. MEDLINE was the only database searched. Hand searches of journals were not performed, and review articles and textbook chapters were not systematically searched. However, important studies known to domain experts that were missed by the electronic literature searches were added to the retrieved articles and reviewed by the Work Group.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Text articles were extracted by the Evidence Review Team (ERT) onto forms customized to capture data on design, methodology, baseline characteristics, interventions or predictors, comparators, outcomes, results, and limitations of individual studies. Study methodology and risk of bias were also systematically graded for each outcome and recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Tables</strong></p>
<p>Pertinent information for systematic review topics was tabulated in summary tables. Summary tables list outcomes of interest as well as relevant population characteristics, descriptions of interventions and comparators, results, and quality grades for each outcome. Categorical and continuous outcomes were summarized separately. Work Group members reviewed all summary table data and quality grades.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Profiles</strong></p>
<p>Evidence profiles are usually constructed as a means to assess the quality and record quality grades and descriptions of effect for each outcome across studies, as well as the quality grades and description of net benefits or harms of the intervention or comparator across studies. These profiles aim to make the evidence synthesis process transparent. However, since no treatment or non-treatment topic had more than one study in a summary table for which the quality was graded, no evidence profiles were generated, and the information in the summary table shows the highest level of synthesis.</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence for Outcomes of Individual Studies</strong></p>
<p>Methodological quality (internal validity) refers to the design, conduct, and reporting of outcomes of a clinical study. A previously devised three-level classification system for quality assessment was used to grade the overall study quality and quality of all relevant outcomes in the study (see Table 39 in the original guideline document). Variations of this system have been used in most Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and all Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and have been recommended for the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center program.</p>
<p>Each study was given an overall quality grade on the basis of its design, methodology (randomization, allocation, blinding, definition of outcomes, appropriate use of statistical methods, etc.), conduct (drop-out percentage, outcome assessment methodologies, etc.), and reporting (internal consistency, clarity, thoroughness, and precision, etc.). Each reported outcome was then evaluated and given an individual grade depending on the quality of reporting and methodological issues specific to that outcome. However, the quality grade of an individual outcome could not exceed the quality grade for the overall study.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence and the Strength of Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, was used to grade the quality of the overall evidence and the strength of recommendations for each topic. This grading scheme with two levels for the strength of a recommendation together with four levels of grading for the quality of the evidence, as well as the option of an ungraded statement for general guidance was adopted by the KDIGO Board in December 2008.</p>
<p>The quality of a body of evidence refers to the extent to which the Work Group's confidence in an estimate of effect is sufficient to support a particular recommendation. The process of transparently grading evidence and recommendations for treatment topics is described below in further detail. However, the approach had to be adapted for the main topics of the KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline because they were not treatment-related topics.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence for Each Outcome Across Studies</strong></p>
<p>Following the GRADE approach, the quality of a body of evidence pertaining to a particular outcome of interest was initially categorized on the basis of study design (see Table 40 in the original guideline document). For questions of interventions, the initial quality grade was high if the body of evidence consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), low if it consisted of observational studies, and very low if it consisted of studies of other designs. For questions of interventions, the Work Group decided to use only RCTs. The grade for the quality of evidence for each intervention&ndash;outcome pair was then lowered if there were serious limitations to the methodological quality of the aggregate of studies, if there was thought to be a high likelihood of bias, if there were important inconsistencies in the results across studies, if there was uncertainty about the directness of evidence (including limited applicability of the findings to the population of interest), if the data were sparse (for example if there was only one study or if the results include just a few events or observations and were uninformative) or imprecise (for example the confidence interval [CI] spans a range greater than 1 or confidence limits are &lt;0.5 to &gt;2.0). The final grade for the quality of the evidence for an intervention&ndash;outcome pair was then assigned as high, moderate, low, or very low (see Table 40 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Overall Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the overall body of evidence was then determined on the basis of the quality grades for all outcomes of interest, taking into account explicit judgments about the relative importance of each outcome. The resulting four final categories for the quality of overall evidence were A, B, C, and D (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration Among Participants</strong></p>
<p>The KDIGO Co-Chairs appointed the Work Group Co-Chairs, who then assembled the Work Group of domain experts, including individuals with expertise in internal medicine, adult and pediatric nephrology, diabetology/endocrinology, clinical chemistry, and epidemiology. The Tufts Center for Kidney Disease Guideline Development and Implementation at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, was contracted to conduct a systematic evidence review and provide expertise in guideline development methodology. The ERT consisted of physician&ndash;methodologists with expertise in nephrology, a project coordinator, a research assistant, and a medical writer&ndash;editor. The ERT instructed and advised Work Group members in all steps of literature review, critical literature appraisal, and guideline development. The Work Group and the ERT collaborated closely throughout the project.</p>
<p>The Work Group and its Chairs, KDIGO Co-chairs, ERT, and KDIGO support staff met for three 2-day meetings for training in the guideline development process, topic discussion, and consensus development.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, the ERT offered suggestions for guideline development and led discussions on systematic review, literature searches, data extraction, assessment of quality and applicability of articles, evidence synthesis, grading of evidence and guideline recommendations, and consensus development. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the recommendation statements and rationales and retained final responsibility for their content.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Scope and Topics</strong></p>
<p>This KDIGO CKD guideline was set out to update the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for CKD: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification in 2002, which spans many topics related to the diagnosis, classification, stratification, and management of CKD.</p>
<p>The Work Group Co-Chairs prepared the first draft of the scope of work document as a series of open-ended questions to be considered by Work Group members. At their first 2-day meeting, members added further questions until the initial working document included all topics of interest to the Work Group. The inclusive, combined set of questions formed the basis for the deliberation and discussion that followed. The Work Group strove to ensure that all topics deemed clinically relevant and worthy of review were identified and addressed.</p>
<p>Updating the topics of definitions and classification was based on the output from the KDIGO Controversies Conference and the CKD Prognosis Consortium.</p>
<p>Additional topics that relate to explicit selection of diagnostic tests or interventions were chosen to undergo systematic review of the best available evidence. Systematic evidence review entails <em>a priori</em> question formulation, specification of important outcomes for the review, systematic searches, data extraction, tabulation, analysis, and synthesis of evidence and is described in detail for each of the specific questions.</p>
<p>The eight topics for which the ERT conducted searches and evidence review are shown in Table 37 of the original guideline document. For the systematic review topics, the Work Group and ERT further developed and refined each topic and specified screening criteria, literature search strategies, and data extraction forms.</p>
<p>Many other topics were not suitable to be addressed by in-depth evidence review. When the anticipated outcome of an extensive literature search was unlikely to yield evidence that directly informs practice choices, the approach chosen was that of a narrative review.</p>
<p>The Work Group took on the primary role of writing the recommendations and rationale statements and retained final responsibility for the content of the guideline statements and the accompanying narrative. The ERT reviewed draft recommendations and grades for consistency with the conclusions of the evidence review.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Questions of Interest</strong></p>
<p>Questions of interest were formulated according to the PICODD (Population, Intervention or Predictor, Comparator, Outcome, study Design, and Duration of follow-up) criteria. Details of the PICODD criteria are presented in Table 37 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Quality of Evidence and the Strength of Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>A structured approach, based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, was used to grade the quality of the overall evidence and the strength of recommendations for each topic. This grading scheme&mdash;with two levels for the strength of a recommendation together with four levels of grading for the quality of the evidence, as well as the option of an ungraded statement for general guidance&mdash;was adopted by the KDIGO Board in December 2008.</p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation indicates the extent to which one can be confident that adherence to the recommendation will do more good than harm. The process of transparently grading evidence and recommendations for treatment topics is described below in further detail. However, the approach had to be adapted for the main topics of the KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline because they were not treatment-related topics.</p></div></p>

<p class="Note">*The additional category 'Not Graded' was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence. The most common examples include recommendations regarding monitoring intervals, counseling, and referral to other clinical specialists. The ungraded recommendations are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations.</p></div></p>

<p>As with all Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines a two step process was used. This included a review by the Board of Directors, with feedback to the Work Group Chairs followed by revisions to the document. The public review, consisting of interested stakeholders from international communities, organizations and individuals, was then undertaken. The draft document was sent to a total of 2,320 external reviewers, with 293 responses received and tabulated. The feedback was carefully reviewed and where appropriate, suggested changes were incorporated into the final document. In the interest of transparency, the Work Group prepared individual responses to each reviewer comment and these will be posted on the KDIGO website.</p></div></p>

<p>Although the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive. MEDLINE was the only database searched. Hand searches of journals were not performed, and review articles and textbook chapters were not systematically searched. However, important studies known to domain experts that were missed by the electronic literature searches were added to the retrieved articles and reviewed by the Work Group.</p>
<p><strong>Use of the Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This Clinical Practice Guideline document is based upon systematic literature searches last conducted in June 2011, supplemented with additional evidence through November 2012. It is designed to provide information and assist decision making. It is not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. The recommendations for research contained within this document are general and do not imply a specific protocol. </li>
    <li>The guideline will provide a blueprint for an approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) care in an international context. While the guideline will be sensitive to issues related to ethnicity and also geographical considerations, it is expected that subsequent regional adaptation will be required for specific healthcare settings or contexts. </li>
    <li>This document is not intended to provide enough detail to replace training and education in nephrology, nor is it intended to serve as a textbook of medicine or nephrology. </li>
