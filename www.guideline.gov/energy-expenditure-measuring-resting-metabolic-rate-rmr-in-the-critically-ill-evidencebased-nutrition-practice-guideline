<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Energy Expenditure (EE): Thermic Effect of Feeding in Critically Ill</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>EE: Thermic Effect of Continuous Feeding in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not a critically ill patient is receiving continuous infusion of an energy source (e.g., energy-containing intravenous fluids or medications, enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition), the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) may proceed with the indirect calorimetry measurement. Based on limited evidence comparing continuous feeding to fasting, the presence of a thermic effect of continuous feeding (TEF) is inconclusive. Waiting for infusion of an energy source or holding continuous feedings before conducting a measurement of resting metabolic rate (RMR), may not be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Weak</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>EE: Thermic Effect of Bolus or Intermittent Feeding in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>Following a bolus or intermittent feeding in the critically ill patient, the RDN should wait at least four hours to do an indirect calorimetry measurement. Delaying the indirect calorimetry measurement is recommended, because of the potential TEF during the post-absorptive state.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EE: Diurnal (Time of Day) Variation in Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Diurnal Variation in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>If the critically ill patient is mechanically ventilated and receiving continuous feedings, then the RDN may conduct a measurement of RMR at any time of day, as long as resting conditions can be achieved. Likewise, if a measurement of total energy expenditure (TEE) is being considered, time of day does not need to be taken into account. Research indicates that there is no significant diurnal variation in either RMR or TEE in mechanically ventilated patients receiving continuous feedings. The effect of diurnal variation in critically ill patients who are not mechanically ventilated while receiving continuous feedings is unknown.</p>

<p><strong>EE: Gas Collection Devices in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>If the critically ill patient is spontaneously breathing (not intubated or receiving supplemental oxygen), the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should consider the canopy or hood to conduct a RMR measurement. Typically, the canopy or hood is reasonably tolerated by the patient, fits most patient circumstances and is most likely to produce a complete gas collection. However, patient circumstances or preference may require use of an alternative gas collection device.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EE: Room Conditions in Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Room Conditions for Measuring RMR in Critically Ill Patients</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should ensure RMR is measured in a quiet, thermoneutral environment for the critically ill population. Cool room temperatures or drafts may generate shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis. Research is needed to define the range of thermoneutrality for the critically ill population.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EE: Body Positions in Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: RMR Measurements in the Usual Body Position in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should conduct indirect calorimetry measurements in the critically ill patient who is in the semi-recumbent posture (standard position in the intensive care unit [ICU]). However, it is acceptable to measure the patient in the non-semi-recumbent position, if that is their usual body position. Limited research reports that posture can affect the accuracy of the measurement of RMR in some critically ill patients.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: RMR Measurements after Changes in Usual Body Position in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>In critically ill patients, if the patient's usual body position changes temporarily, the RDN should wait until the patient is moved back into the usual body position in order to perform indirect calorimetry. If the patient's usual body position changes to a new permanent position (e.g., change in head of bed elevation), the RDN should conduct a new indirect calorimetry measurement. See "Rest Period Duration for Measuring RMR" below. Limited research reports that posture can affect the accuracy of the measurement of RMR in some critically ill patients.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EE: Rest Period Duration in Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Rest Period Duration in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should ensure a 30-minute rest period prior to RMR measurement in critically ill patients. One study indicates that energy expenditure is elevated for up to 30 minutes after routine ICU care in non-sedated patients. The potential for sedation to shorten the rest period has not been studied.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EE: Duration of Measurement (Steady State) in Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: Duration of Measurement Related to Steady State in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>When measuring energy expenditure in a critically ill patient, the RDN should discard the data for the first five minutes to exclude artifact and then achieve either a five-minute measure with up to 5% or a 25-minute measurement with up to 10% coefficient of variation (CV) in volume of oxygen (VO<sub>2</sub>) and volume of carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>). Research indicates that these protocols are equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: Measurement Duration if Unable to Achieve Steady State in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>If unable to achieve steady state in critically ill patients, the RDN should take a single indirect calorimetry measurement extended for up to two hours or average two non-consecutive indirect calorimetry measurements within a 24-hour period. Research suggests that this protocol likely reflects 24-hour TEE with acceptable error.</p>

    <li>Conclusion statements are <strong>Grades I</strong> and <strong>II</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EE: Application of Respiratory Quotient (RQ) in Critically Ill</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>EE: RQ within the Physiologic Range in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>If the RQ falls within the physiologic range (0.67 to 1.3) the RDN should not use RQ alone to reject the RMR measurement. Research shows that RQ can be manipulated within the physiologic range by changing respiratory parameters without altering the RMR measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>EE: RQ outside the Physiologic Range in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>If the RQ falls outside the physiologic range (below 0.67 or greater than 1.3), the RDN should suspect an error and repeat the RMR measurement. The physiologic range of RQ reflecting cellular metabolism is 0.67 to 1.3. Values for RQ outside of this range indicate an inaccurate RMR measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>EE: Limitations of RQ in Evaluating Feeding Levels in Critically Ill</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should not rely solely on measured RQ to evaluate level or composition of feeding. Research demonstrates that RQ has poor accuracy to evaluate under- and over-feeding. RQ can vary among individuals at any given feeding level and can be altered by factors unrelated to feeding.</p>

<p><strong>Conditional vs Imperative Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations are categorized in terms of either <strong><em>conditional</em></strong> or <strong><em>imperative</em></strong> statements. While conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their application.</p>
<p>Conditional recommendations are presented in an if/then format, such that:</p>
<p>If CONDITION then ACTION(S) because REASON(S)</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the condition triggers one or more guideline-specified actions. In contrast, imperative recommendations include terms such as "require," "must," and "should," and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances.</p>

<p>The following list provides an overview of the steps which the Academy evidence analysis team goes through to identify research through database searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Plan the search strategy</strong> to identify the current best evidence relevant to the question. The plan for identification and inclusion of articles and reports should be systematic and reproducible, not haphazard. Write out the original search strategy and document adjustments to the strategy if they occur. Allow for several iterations of searches.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>List inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>. The work group will define the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria will be used in defining the search strategy and for filtering the identified research reports. The Academy uses only peer-reviewed research; that is, articles accepted for evidence analysis must be peer-reviewed and published in a juried publication. Additionally, the Academy only uses human subjects in its research and does not include animal studies in its evidence analysis. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify search words</strong>. During the process of considering outcomes, interventions, nutrition diagnoses, and assessments, the work group may have identified a number of specific terms or factors that were important, but were not included in the actual question. These terms can be used as additional search terms to help identify relevant pieces of research. Both text word search and keyword search using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) definitions may be used. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify databases to search</strong>. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Agricola, DARE, TRIP, AHRQ and ERIC are some common databases for clinical nutritional research. Note that search terms can vary depending on the database. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conduct the search</strong>. Depending on the number and type of sources found in the initial search, adjustments might have to be made in the search strategy and to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and additional searches run. Changes to the search plan should be recorded for future reference. Document the number of sources identified in each search. </li>
    <li><strong>Review titles and abstracts</strong>. At this point, a filtering procedure is used to determine whether a research article matches the inclusion criteria and is relevant to the work group's questions. Typically, the lead analyst, along with a member of the expert workgroup, first reviews the citations and abstracts to filter out reports that are not applicable to the question. If a determination cannot be made based on the citation and abstract, then the full text of the article is obtained for review. </li>
    <li><strong>Gather all remaining articles and reports</strong>. Obtain paper or electronic copies of research articles that remain on the list following the citation and abstract review. If there are less than six citations, it could mean that the search was too specific to identify relevant research or that research has not been done on this topic. A broadened search should be tried. When there is a long list of citations, ascertain whether it includes articles that are tangential to the question or address the question in only a general way. In this case a more focused search strategy may be necessary. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specific Methods for This Guideline</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations in the guideline were based on a systematic review of the literature. Searches of Ovid MEDLINE were performed on the following topics:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Thermic effect of feeding </li>
    <li>Diurnal variation </li>
    <li>Gas collection devices </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Step 1: Formulate Evidence Analysis Question</strong></p>
<p>Specify a question in a defined area of practice or state a tentative conclusion or recommendation that is being considered. Include the patient type and special needs of the target population involved, the alternatives under consideration, and the outcomes of interest (PICO format).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Gather and Classify Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Conduct a systematic search of the literature to find evidence related to the question, gather studies and reports, and classify them by type of evidence. Classes differentiate primary reports of new data according to study design, and distinguish them from secondary reports that include systematic and/or narrative review.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Critically Appraise Each Article</strong></p>
<p>Review each article for relevance to the question and use the checklist of questions to evaluate the research design and implementation. Abstract key information from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Summarize Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Synthesize the reports into an overview table and summarize the research relevant to the question.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Write and Grade the Conclusion Statement</strong></p>
<p>Develop a concise conclusion statement (the answer to the question). Assign a grade to indicate the overall strength or weakness of evidence informing the conclusion statement (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Development of Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert work group, which includes practitioners and researchers with a depth of experience in the specific field of interest, develops the disease-specific guideline. The guideline development involves the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Review the Conclusion Statements</strong>: The work group meets to review the materials resulting from the evidence analysis, which may include conclusion statements, evidence summaries, and evidence worksheets. </li>
    <li><strong>Formulate Recommendations for the Guideline Integrating Conclusions from Evidence Analysis</strong>: The work group uses an expert consensus method to formulate the guideline recommendations and complete the various sections on the recommendation page. These include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Recommendation(s)</strong>: This is a course of action for the practitioner. The recommendation is written using two brief and separate statements. The first statement is "what" the dietitian should do or not do. The second statement describes the "why" of the recommendation. More than one recommendation may be formulated depending on a particular topic and the supporting conclusion statements. </li>
        <li><strong>Rating</strong>: The rating for the recommendation is based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The grade of the supporting conclusion statement(s) will help determine this rating (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). </li>
        <li><strong>Label of Conditional or Imperative</strong>: Each recommendation will have a label of "conditional" or "imperative." Conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, while imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population without restraints on their pertinence. </li>
        <li><strong>Risks and Harms of Implementing the Recommendations</strong>: Includes any potential risks, anticipated harms or adverse consequences associated with applying the recommendation(s) to the target population. </li>
        <li><strong>Conditions of Application</strong>: Includes any organizational barriers or changes that would need to be made within an organization to apply the recommendation in daily practice. Also includes any conditions which may limit the application of the recommendation(s). For instance, application may be limited to only people in an inpatient setting, or not applicable for pregnant women. Facilitators for the application of the guideline may also be listed here. Conditional recommendations will always have conditions specified. Imperative recommendations may have some general conditions for application. </li>
        <li><strong>Potential Costs Associated with Application</strong>: Includes any costs that may be associated with the application of this recommendation such as specialized staff, new equipment or treatments. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Narrative</strong>: Provides a brief description of the evidence that supports this recommendation. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong>: Provides a brief list of the evidence strength and methodological issues that determined the recommendation strength. </li>
        <li><strong>Minority Opinions</strong>: If the expert work group cannot reach consensus on the recommendation, the minority opinions may be listed here. </li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Evidence</strong>: Provides links to the conclusions statements, evidence summaries and worksheets related to the formulation of this recommendation(s). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process</strong>: Recommendations are based on the summarized evidence from the analysis. Sources that are not analyzed during the evidence analysis process may be used to support and formulate the recommendation or to support information under other categories on the recommendation page, if the workgroup deems necessary. References must be credible resources (e.g., consensus reports, other guidelines, position papers, standards of practice, articles from peer-reviewed journals, nationally recognized documents or websites). If recommendations are based solely on these types of references, they will be rated as "consensus." Occasionally recommendations will include references that were not reviewed during the evidence analysis process but are relevant to the recommendation, risks and harms of implementing the recommendation, conditions of application, or potential costs associated with application. These references will be listed on the recommendation page under "References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process." </li>
    <li><strong>Develop a Clinical Algorithm for The Guideline</strong>: The workgroup develops a clinical algorithm based on Academy's Nutrition Care Process, to display how each recommendation can be used within the treatment process and how they relate to the Nutrition Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete the Writing of the Guideline</strong>: Each disease-specific guideline has a similar format which incorporates the Introduction (includes: Scope of the Guideline, Statement of Intent, Guideline Methods, Implementation, Benefits and Risks/Harms of Implementation), Background Information and any necessary Appendices. The work group develops these features. </li>
    <li><strong>Criteria Used in Guideline Development</strong>: The criteria used in determining the format and process for development of Academy's guidelines are based on the following tools and criteria for evidence-based guidelines:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Guideline Elements Model (GEM) which has been incorporated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a Standard Specification for clinical practice guidelines. </li>

<p class="Note">*Conclusion statements are assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. Grade I is good; grade II, fair; grade III, limited; grade IV signifies expert opinion only and grade V indicates that a grade is not assignable because there is no evidence to support or refute the conclusion. The evidence and these grades are considered when assigning a rating (Strong, Fair, Weak, Consensus, Insufficient Evidence - see chart above) to a recommendation.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Safety issues should be considered for each recommendation. </li>
    <li>Failure to measure the resting metabolic rate (RMR) accurately may result in incorrect diagnosis of the energy state, inaccurate therapy for patients who want to gain or lose body weight, or overfeeding or underfeeding of critically ill patients. </li>
    <li>Not following the guideline may result in inappropriate nutrition support due to inaccurate RMR measurement. </li>
    <li>Moving the patient only for the measurement of indirect calorimetry may increase the risk of injury, pain, and negative health outcomes to patients. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This nutrition practice guideline is meant to serve as a general framework for handling clients with particular health problems. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. </li>
    <li>While evidence-based nutrition practice guidelines represent a statement of best practice based on the latest available evidence at the time of publishing, they are not intended to overrule professional judgment. Rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. These nutrition practice guidelines are provided with the express understanding that they do not establish or specify particular standards of care, whether legal, medical or other. </li>
    <li>This guideline recognizes the role of patient preferences for possible outcomes of care, when the appropriateness of a clinical intervention involves a substantial element of personal choice or values. With regard to types of evidence that are associated with particular outcomes, two major classes have been described. Patient-oriented evidence that matters (POEM) deals with outcomes of importance to patients, such as changes in morbidity, mortality or quality of life. Disease-oriented evidence (DOE) deals with surrogate end-points, such as changes in laboratory values or other measures of response. Although the results of DOE sometimes parallel the results of POEM, they do not always correspond. When possible, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends using POEM-type evidence rather than DOE. When DOE is the only guidance available, the guideline indicates that key clinical recommendations lack the support of outcomes evidence. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The publication of this guideline is an integral part of the plans for getting the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics evidence-based recommendations on critical illness to all dietetics practitioners engaged in, teaching about or researching Measuring Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) in the Critically Ill as quickly as possible. National implementation workshops at various sites around the country and during the Academy Food Nutrition Conference Expo (FNCE) are planned. Additionally, there are recommended dissemination and adoption strategies for local use of the Academy's Measuring Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) in the Critically Ill Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline.</p>
<p>The guideline development team recommended multi-faceted strategies to disseminate the guideline and encourage its implementation. Management support and learning through social influence are likely to be effective in implementing guidelines in dietetic practice. However, additional interventions may be needed to achieve real change in practice routines.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Measuring Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) in the Critically Ill Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline will be achieved by announcement at professional events, presentations and training. Some strategies include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>National and local events</strong>: State dietetic association meetings and media coverage will help launch the guideline. </li>
    <li><strong>Local feedback adaptation</strong>: Presentation by members of the work group at peer review meetings and opportunities for continuing education units (CEUs) for courses completed. </li>
    <li><strong>Education initiatives</strong>: The guideline and supplementary resources will be freely available for use in the education and training of dietetic interns and students in approved Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) programs. </li>
    <li><strong>Champions</strong>: Local champions will be identified and expert members of the recommendation team will prepare articles for publications. Resources will be provided that include PowerPoint presentations and pre-prepared case studies. </li>
    <li><strong>Practical tools</strong>: Some of the tools that will be developed to help implement the guideline include specially designed resources such as clinical algorithms, a tool kit, and a slide presentation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific distribution strategies include:</p>
<p><strong>Publication in full</strong>: The guideline will be available electronically at the <a href="/web/20180712211340/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48763&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.andeal.org%2fdefault.cfm%3f" title="AND Evidence Analysis Library Web site">Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712211340im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/> and will be announced to all Academy Dietetic Practice Groups.
