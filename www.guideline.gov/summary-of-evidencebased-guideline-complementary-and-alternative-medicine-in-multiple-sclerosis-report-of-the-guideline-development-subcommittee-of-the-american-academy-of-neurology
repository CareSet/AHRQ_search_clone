                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cannabinoids</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cannabinoid Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might offer oral cannabis extract (OCE) to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to reduce patient-reported symptoms of spasticity and pain (excluding central neuropathic pain) (<strong>Level A</strong>) and might counsel patients that this symptomatic benefit is possibly maintained for 1 year (<strong>Level C</strong>), although OCE is probably ineffective for improving objective spasticity measures (short-term) or tremor (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might offer tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to patients with MS to reduce patient-reported symptoms of spasticity and pain (excluding central neuropathic pain) (<strong>Level B</strong>). Clinicians might counsel patients that this symptomatic benefit is possibly maintained for 1 year (<strong>Level C</strong>), although THC is probably ineffective for improving objective spasticity measures (short-term) or tremor (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might offer Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray (nabiximols), where available, to reduce symptoms of spasticity, pain, or urinary frequency, although it is probably ineffective for improving objective spasticity measures or number of urinary incontinence episodes (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might choose not to offer Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray to reduce MS-related tremor (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Data are inadequate to support or refute use of the following in MS (<strong>Level U</strong>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>OCE/THC for bladder urge incontinence and overall symptoms </li>
    <li>Synthetic THC (Marinol) for central neuropathic pain </li>
    <li>Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray for overall bladder symptoms, anxiety symptoms/sleep problems, cognitive symptoms, quality of life (QOL), and fatigue </li>
    <li>Smoked cannabis for spasticity, pain, balance/posture, and cognition </li>
</ol>
<p>Data are inadequate to determine the abuse potential or effect on psychopathologic symptoms of Sativex cannabinoid spray (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>The cannabinoid studies have limitations that physicians and patients must be aware of. Most studies were of short duration (6 to 15 weeks). Another limitation was the potential for central side effects to unmask patients to treatment assignment &mdash; a concern with regard to all masked trials involving treatments with prominent side effects. It is also important to recognize that the Ashworth scale used for objective measurement may be insensitive to spasticity changes. These factors may contribute to the discordant effects of cannabinoids on subjective and objective spasticity measures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ginkgo Biloba (GB)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>GB Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that GB is established as ineffective for improving cognitive function (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that GB is possibly effective for reducing fatigue (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>GB and other supplements are not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated. Their quality control may play a role in their effectiveness and adverse effect (AE) risk. Moreover, interactions of supplements with other medications, especially disease-modifying therapies for MS, are a clinical concern.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Low-Fat Diet with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation (Omega-3)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Omega-3 Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients that a low-fat diet with fish oil supplementation is probably ineffective for reducing relapses, disability, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, or for improving fatigue or QOL in MS (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lofepramine</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lofepramine Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that lofepramine plus L-phenylalanine with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (Cari Loder regimen) is possibly ineffective for treating disability, symptoms, depression, or fatigue (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reflexology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflexology Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that reflexology is possibly effective for reducing paresthesia (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bee Venom</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bee Venom Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that bee sting therapy is possibly ineffective for reducing relapses, disability, fatigue, total MRI lesion burden, new gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume, or health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Bee stings can be associated with anaphylactic reaction and possible death.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Magnetic Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Therapy Practice Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that magnetic therapy is probably effective for reducing fatigue (<strong>Level B</strong>) and probably ineffective for reducing depression (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other CAM Therapies Practice Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should counsel patients with MS that the safety and efficacy of other reviewed CAM, or the interaction of CAM with disease-modifying therapies for MS, are unknown (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Therapeutic Interventions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>

<p>Two panelists reviewed the full text of these articles. Cooling and Feldenkrais therapies were excluded because they were included in a guideline in development that evaluates rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Table e-3 in the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies with no evidence from studies in MS subjects.</p>
<p>Several validated scales, listed next, were used to assess outcomes (see Table e-1 in the data supplement).</p>
<p>Where ordinal scales that were not well validated were used, the panel interpreted results cautiously, in concert with results from other validated scales. When evaluating studies of cannabis on pain, the panel graded separately the evidence for pain associated with spasticity and the evidence for pain specified to be of central, neuropathic origin, and made separate recommendations. Where necessary, the panel performed a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons for studies reporting multiple secondary outcomes.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cannabinoids were generally well tolerated, although some serious adverse effects (SAEs) were reported. Few studies reported deaths in the cannabinoid-treated groups (1 due to pneumonia, 1 to seizure-related aspiration pneumonia, and 2 to cancer, presumed unrelated). Mild/moderate adverse effects (AEs) were common (approximately 50% to 80% of subjects) and appeared to be equally prevalent in subjects receiving cannabinoids or placebo. No significant laboratory, hematologic, urologic, or cardiac changes, or differences in vital signs, were noted. Central nervous system (CNS) AEs (e.g., dizziness, somnolence, drowsiness, lightheadedness, memory disturbance, difficulty concentrating) were more common in subjects receiving cannabinoids vs placebo. Dizziness was most common (15% to 50% of subjects). Gastrointestinal AEs, including increased appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and dry/sore mouth, occurred in about 10% of subjects receiving cannabinoids and were more common in those receiving cannabinoids than placebo. Other less common AEs included myalgia, increased spasticity, seizures (4/137 subjects had seizures), lower limb weakness, hemorrhagic cystitis, dehydration, temporary psychosis (1 rated as severe), hallucinations, and oral ulceration. </li>
    <li>Because cannabinoids have known psychoactive properties, their potential for psychopathologic and neurocognitive AEs is a concern, especially in a patient population that may be vulnerable due to underlying disorders. Depression and predisposal to psychosis have been reported with long-term cannabis exposure. Development of marijuana addiction is controversial; however, long-term heavy marijuana use has been associated with tolerance and dependence. Evidence is also available, albeit inconsistent, for impairments in memory, concentration, and executive functions in chronic cannabis users, although it remains unclear how long these deficits persist after abstinence and whether there is permanent neurotoxicity. In 1 study, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and prolonged use of "street" cannabis had cognitive function impairments relative to patients with MS who did not use cannabis. Patients with MS who smoked cannabis regularly had more extensive cognitive abnormalities and were more likely to meet criteria for a lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) psychiatric diagnosis. Although not generalizable to medical cannabis, the associations from these studies of street cannabis raise concerns. A substudy of the large Class I study reviewed, available only in abstract form, reported a significant reduction in verbal learning and memory in patients with MS receiving cannabis extracts vs those receiving placebo. Several of the reviewed studies assessed psychopathology and cognition as secondary outcomes without significant AEs; however, these studies were short-term and inadequately powered to exclude an effect. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel patients about the potential for psychopathologic/cognitive and other AEs associated with cannabinoids. Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and is unavailable in the United States. In the United States, caution should be exercised with regard to extrapolation of results of trials of standardized oral cannabis extracts (OCEs) (which are unavailable commercially) to other nonstandardized, nonregulated cannabis extracts (which may be commercially available in states with medical marijuana laws) </li>
    <li>Ginkgo biloba (GB) and other supplements are not FDA regulated. Their quality control may play a role in their effectiveness and AE risk. Moreover, interactions of supplements with other medications, especially disease-modifying therapies for MS, are a clinical concern. </li>
    <li>One study on magnetic therapy reported headache, spasms, and burning sensation. </li>

    <li>The review on which the original guideline is based has several limitations. Because the search strategy is limited only to multiple sclerosis (MS), some potentially important adverse effects (AEs) (e.g., bleeding risk with gingko biloba [GB]) of the reviewed therapies noted when they were evaluated in other diseases were not apparent in the MS population. Therapies that have received much press attention (e.g., dental amalgam removal, transdermal histamine) have little evidence to support recommendations. </li>
    <li>This statement is provided as an educational service of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). It is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. It is not intended to include all possible proper methods of care for a particular neurologic problem or all legitimate criteria for choosing to use a specific procedure. Neither is it intended to exclude any reasonable alternative methodologies. The AAN recognizes that specific patient care decisions are the prerogative of the patient and the physician caring for the patient, based on all of the circumstances involved. The clinical context section is made available in order to place the evidence-based guideline(s) into perspective with current practice habits and challenges. Formal practice recommendations are not intended to replace clinical judgment. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em> peer reviewers and representatives from related fields.
