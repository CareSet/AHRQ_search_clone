                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified literature.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The literature search for the CCO review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) was performed using the MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE[R] In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE[R]) and EMBASE databases (2003 to June 2012). The Cochrane Library was searched for systematic reviews and technology assessments. The annual meeting proceedings of ASCO and the American Urological Association were searched for relevant abstracts in from 2009 to 2012.</p>
<p>For this clinical practice guideline, the literature search to June 2012 and results of the systematic review conducted by CCO were considered to be of high quality and currency to be endorsed for use by the guideline expert panel. An updated search of the MEDLINE database was conducted to June 2014 to search for any additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that could inform recommendations. The literature search will be replicated for periodic updates of the guideline. Additions to this guideline were triggered by publications and meeting presentations of phase III clinical trials through June 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the CCO systematic review if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Were RCTs or evidence synthesis products based on RCTs </li>
    <li>Included men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) </li>
    <li>Compared systemic therapy, alone or in combination with other agents, versus placebo or other drug regimens </li>
    <li>Were published English-language reports </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they involved only androgen-deprivation therapy, bone targeted agents, or radionuclides. Trials were required to have &ge;50 patients per study arm, and in mixed study populations, 90% of men were required to have metastases.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) reported that primary outcome measures of interest included overall survival, progression-free survival, time-to-progression, time-to-treatment failure, objective tumor response, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, palliative or symptomatic response, quality of life, and/or adverse events. According to the process used at CCO, abstracts were reviewed and papers were deemed appropriate for full text review and data extraction by one reviewer. These data were also reviewed by the lead and corresponding authors. Data were extracted by one reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the lead authors if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Study Quality Assessment and Limitations of Literature: CCO Review</strong></p>
<p>In the CCO review, study quality was formally assessed and summarized by one reviewer for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified. In that review, design aspects related to individual study quality were generally assessed as moderate to high quality, with factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, and funding sources, generally indicating a relatively low risk of bias for most of the identified trials (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Since the time of that quality appraisal, two of the trials have published their findings, with additional details reported around quality elements. Hence, the quality appraisal from the CCO review is slightly more conservative in its estimation of potential biases associated with the body of evidence.</p>
<p>Several factors related to increased potential for bias for the overall body of evidence to inform recommendations were also reported. Seven of the trials were phase II studies, seven trials were terminated early, three trials offered crossover after preplanned interim analyses, and four trials were reported as conference proceedings (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Primary outcomes varied across the trials, and in the majority of cases, studies were not directly comparable, because different treatments and regimens were used at different time points in the patient treatment trajectory.</p>
<p>One included phase III double-blind RCT was published subsequent to the CCO quality appraisal. In that trial, 921 patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of two to one to radium-223 (<sup>223</sup>Ra) or placebo. That trial was terminated for efficacy as part of a preplanned interim analysis. Using the same quality metrics reported in the CCO review, that trial was not considered to be at high risk of potential bias.</p>
<p><strong>Study Quality Assessment: American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Review</strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified by both CCO and ASCO. For the ASCO quality assessment, design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for most of the identified evidence.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Panel Composition</strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)&nbsp;Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Program in Evidence-Based Care convened an expert panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, urologic oncology, radiation oncology, community oncology, patient advocacy, health services, implementation research, and guideline methodology. Members of the expert panel are listed in Appendix Table A1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; work on the guideline was completed primarily through the writing group, along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations, including an assessment of benefits and harms associated with treatments based on consideration of the evidence. All members of the expert panel participated in preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> for peer review.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software<sup>&trade;</sup>. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div></p>

    <li>Patients should be fully informed about the extent of potential harm and cost of treatment before making decisions. Many patients misunderstand the goals of care in the setting of metastatic disease to be curative rather than palliative. This may lead to decisions to accept excess toxicity or cost based on incorrect assumptions. </li>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinicians are advised to review the published regimens discussed in this guideline for their use in appropriate patient populations and for applicable dose selections/modifications, available from the product labels. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient published evidence to recommend specific sequencing of these therapies or combinations of these therapies, except as otherwise noted. </li>
    <li>The distinction made in some clinical trials between pre- and postdocetaxel treatment contexts should not play a role in selecting therapies for individual patients, unless otherwise noted. </li>
    <li>Patients may place a higher importance on quality of life (QOL) rather than length of life. It is essential to understand individual patient values and preferences for appropriate treatment decision making. Many patients with incurable metastatic disease misperceive the goals of care to be curative. Clear communication about goals as well as potential benefits and harms of care should be prioritized. </li>
    <li>Cost and availability considerations may reasonably influence treatment decisions. There is wide variation in the financial burden individual patients face for various therapies, and this potential barrier or hardship should be openly discussed with patients. </li>
    <li>Most phase III clinical trials have included patients with good baseline performance status. The choice of for patients with diminished performance status is not clearly informed by existing evidence in most cases. </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, as well as the need to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely throughout the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>. The Appendix in the original guideline document provides results of a questionnaire for guideline implementability review.</p>
