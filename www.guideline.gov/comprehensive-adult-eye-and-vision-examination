    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in the enhanced ability to effectively diagnose any eye or vision problem in adults. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">*<strong>Note</strong>: Specific tests and procedures listed are provided as examples only and are not a complete listing of testing options. Clinicians should remain alert for new and emerging technologies, instruments and procedures, and incorporate them into the clinical examination, as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: Any systemic medication or supplement used by patients should be investigated by their eye doctor for ocular risk factors or side effects.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to assist eye doctors in determining the potential risks or side effects any medication or supplement may have on a patient's eye health or vision. The benefits of this recommendation were established by an expert consensus opinion. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus-Based Action Statement</strong>: Pharmacologic dilation of the pupil is generally required for thorough stereoscopic evaluation of the ocular media, retinal vasculature, macula, optic nerve, and the peripheral retina.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation would enhance the ability to diagnose ocular disease. Potential harms involve adverse reactions to drugs used for dilation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Action Statement</strong>: Because of possible variations in measurements obtained when using various intraocular pressure (IOP) testing instruments/techniques, eye doctors should consider taking more than one reading with the same instrument to reduce measurement error (Carbonaro et al., 2010).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: <strong>Grade C</strong>, Observational Study. No randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews were identified regarding the variability of IOP measurements. </li>
    <li><strong>Clinical Recommendation Level</strong>: <strong>Recommendation</strong>. Eye doctors should generally follow this recommendation, but should remain alert for new information. </li>
    <li><strong>Evidence Statement</strong>: There can be significant differences in the measurements obtained using different IOP testing methods. The clinician needs to be aware of these differences when using any particular instrument or technique. <strong>Evidence Quality: Grade C</strong>. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Benefits</strong>: Preventing and/or minimizing vision loss through early diagnosis, treatment, and management of ocular health conditions. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Risks/Harms</strong>: Allergic responses to diagnostic pharmaceutical agents or other adverse effects. </li>

    <li><strong>Potential Costs</strong>: Direct cost of testing as a component of a comprehensive eye and vision examination. </li>
    <li><strong>Value Judgments</strong>: Repeat measurement of IOP using the same instrument/technique can reduce the chances of measurement error and help ensure appropriate patient diagnosis and management. </li>
    <li><strong>Role of Patient Preferences</strong>: Small. </li>
    <li><strong>Intentional Vagueness</strong>: Specific type of IOP instruments/techniques are not specified as they are considered practice of medicine decisions. </li>
    <li><strong>Gaps in Evidence</strong>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of IOP tests/instruments currently used to diagnose glaucoma in adult patients. </li>
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of new or emerging technologies/instrumentation in the diagnosis of glaucoma. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Action Statement</strong>: Eye doctors should not rely on a single, normal confrontation visual field test result as proof that a field loss is not present and should conduct threshold visual field testing on patients if there is a clinical suspicion of a visual field defect. (Kerr et al., 2010; Shahinfar, Johnson, &amp; Madsen, 1995)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: <strong>Grade B</strong>, Cohort study and <strong>Grade C</strong>, Diagnostic study. No randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews were identified regarding the sensitivity of confrontation visual field testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Clinical Recommendation Level</strong>: <strong>Recommendation</strong>. Eye doctors should generally follow this recommendation, but should remain alert for new information. </li>
    <li><strong>Evidence Statements</strong>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The diagnostic accuracy of confrontation visual field testing is low for mild to moderate visual field defects and when performed as a standalone test. The sensitivity of confrontation testing can be improved by using two testing procedures (e.g., kinetic testing with a 5 mm red target along with static finger wiggle testing). Formal perimetry should be conducted if there is a suspicion of a visual field defect. <strong>Evidence Quality: Grade B</strong>. </li>
        <li>When only an individual test is performed, confrontation visual field testing is sensitive for only very dense visual field defects. However, there is high positive predictive value when a confrontation visual field loss is demonstrated. Therefore confrontation visual field testing is not without value. Clinicians should not rely on a negative confrontation result as proof that a field loss is not present. <strong>Evidence Quality: Grade C</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Benefits</strong>: Decreased likelihood that a visual field defect will be missed. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Risks/Harms</strong>: No adverse effects of testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Benefits significantly outweigh harms. </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Costs</strong>: Direct cost of testing as a component of a comprehensive eye and vision examination </li>
    <li><strong>Value Judgments</strong>: The sensitivity of confrontation visual field testing can vary depending on the type and location of field loss and the method used to perform the testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Role of Patient Preferences</strong>: Small. </li>
    <li><strong>Intentional Vagueness</strong>: Specific types of confrontation visual field testing are not stated, as they are considered practice of medicine decisions. </li>
    <li><strong>Gaps in Evidence</strong>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of confrontation visual field testing in adult patients. </li>
        <li>Research is needed to support the validity, reliability and repeatability of new or emerging technologies in visual field testing. </li>

<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Levels</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong Recommendation</strong>: Eye doctors should follow this recommendation unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. The quality of evidence provides a clear reason to make a recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Eye doctors should generally follow this recommendation, but should remain alert for new information. The quality of evidence is not as strong, but the benefits exceed the harms or vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>: Eye doctors should be aware of this recommendation, but be flexible in their clinical decision-making and remain alert for new information. No clear advantage has been demonstrated for one approach versus another. There is lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefit and harm.</p></div></p>

    <li>Recommendations made in this guideline do not represent a standard of care. Instead, the recommendations are intended to assist the clinician in the decision-making process. Patient care and treatment should always be based on a clinician's independent professional judgment, given the individual's circumstances, and state laws and regulations. </li>
    <li>The information in this guideline is current to the extent possible as of the date of publication. </li>
    <li>This Guideline describes the optometric examination for patients 18 years of age or older. The individual components are described in general terms because the order and methods of testing vary from practitioner to practitioner, and change as new technology is developed and is made available in the clinical setting. The examination components described are not intended to be all-inclusive. Professional judgment and individual patient symptoms and findings may significantly influence the nature and course of the examination. The examination process may also vary from that delineated in this Guideline according to patient cooperation and comprehension, and the examination setting. For example, professional judgment may dictate modification of the examination for the developmentally delayed or frail adult, or for the adult in an institutional setting such as an extended care facility. </li>
