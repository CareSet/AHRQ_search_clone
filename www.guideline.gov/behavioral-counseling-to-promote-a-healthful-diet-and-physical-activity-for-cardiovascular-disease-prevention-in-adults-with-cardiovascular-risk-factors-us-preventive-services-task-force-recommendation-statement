                        <h3><a href="#">Major Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, D,</strong> or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the levels of certainty regarding net benefit (<strong>High, Moderate,</strong> and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are overweight or obese and have additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention. (<strong>B recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older in primary care settings who are overweight or obese and have known CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or metabolic syndrome). In the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, a substantial majority of participants had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Most studies evaluated interventions that combined counseling on a healthful diet and physical activity and were intensive, with multiple contacts (which may have included individual or group counseling sessions) over extended periods. Interventions involved an average of 5 to 16 contacts over 9 to 12 months depending on their intensity. Most of the sessions were in-person, and many included additional telephone contacts. Interventions generally focused on behavior change, and all included didactic education plus additional support. Most included audit and feedback, problem-solving skills, and individualized care plans. Some trials also focused on medication adherence. Interventions were delivered by specially trained professionals, including dietitians or nutritionists, physiotherapists or exercise professionals, health educators, and psychologists.</p>
<p>Many types of intensive counseling interventions were effective. However, it was not clear how the magnitude of the effect was related to the format of the intervention (for example, face-to-face, individual, group, or telephone), the person providing the counseling, the duration of the intervention, or the number of sessions because different combinations of components were effective (see the Implementation section in the original guideline document for more information on effective interventions). Because of the intensity and expertise required, most interventions were referred from primary care and delivered outside that setting.</p>
<p><strong>Other Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>Tobacco use continues to be one of the most important risk factors for CVD. Helping patients with tobacco cessation is a critical component of CVD prevention. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions to those who use such products. The U.S. Public Health Service has published guidelines to further help clinicians.</p>
<p>Multifaceted approaches with linkages between primary care practices and community resources could increase the effectiveness of interventions. Effective interactions between health care and community interventions, specifically public health and health policy interventions (such as healthy community design and built environment), can support and enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions (more information is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180713034729/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces" target="_blank" title="CDC Web site">www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713034729im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several community-based interventions to promote physical activity, including community-wide campaigns, social support interventions, school-based physical education, and environmental and policy approaches. It also recommends programs promoting diet and physical activity for persons who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes on the basis of strong evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in reducing the incidence of new-onset diabetes. These recommendations are available at <a href="/web/20180713034729/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48483&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thecommunityguide.org" title="Community Guide Web site">www.thecommunityguide.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713034729im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>.</p>
<p>The Million Hearts initiative (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180713034729/http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" title="HHS Web site">http://millionhearts.hhs.gov</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713034729im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>) aims to decrease the number of heart attacks and strokes by 1 million by 2017. It emphasizes the use of effective clinical preventive services combined with multifaceted community prevention strategies.</p>
<p>In 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services jointly issued the "Dietary Guidelines for Americans." The latter also issued complementary physical activity guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF has a wide range of recommendations focusing on CVD prevention. The current recommendation focuses on behavioral counseling that encourages healthy eating and physical activity behaviors to improve cardiovascular health. It does not address weight-loss programs. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively initiate behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity in patients who are not obese and not at increased cardiovascular risk. The USPSTF does not address behavioral counseling in patients with a BMI less than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who are at increased risk for CVD. However, for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater, the USPSTF recommends screening these patients for obesity and offering or referring them to intensive, multicomponent behavioral counseling for weight loss.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<p><strong>Data Sources and Searches</strong></p>
<p>EPC staff searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2001 to October 2013. EPC staff supplemented searches with suggestions from experts and reference lists from other relevant systematic reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed 7218 abstracts and 553 full-text articles against a priori&ndash;specified inclusion criteria (see Appendix A Figure 1 in the evidence report [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). They included studies in adults who had at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, and cigarette smoking. EPC staff excluded studies limited to persons with known diabetes (considered a cardiovascular disease [CVD] risk equivalent), coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or severe chronic kidney disease. They also excluded populations at increased risk for CVD (such as those who are obese, physically inactive, and prehypertensive) but without other CVD risk factors because these bodies of evidence were considered in previous reviews and USPSTF recommendations. EPC staff included behaviorally based counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet or physical activity, delivered alone or as part of a multicomponent intervention. They excluded interventions that provided controlled diets or supervised exercise, as opposed to interventions aimed at evaluating whether counseling could change behavior.</p>
<p>EPC staff limited studies of efficacy or effectiveness to fair- or good-quality randomized, controlled trials or controlled clinical trials that had at least 6 months of follow-up, were done in developed countries, and published their results in 1990 or later. Included trials had to have a control group (such as usual care, a minimal intervention, or attention control). They examined health outcomes (such as morbidity or mortality related to CVD), intermediate health outcomes (such as physiological measures of blood pressure, lipid and glucose, and weight; diabetes incidence; medication use; and composite CVD risk scores), and behavioral outcomes (such as self-reported dietary intake and physical activity or objectively measured markers of behavior change [such as VO<sub>2</sub>max or urinary sodium]). EPC staff also included observational studies that reported serious harms (that is, adverse events resulting in unexpected or unwanted medical attention).</p></div></p>

<p><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>One reviewer extracted population characteristics, study design elements, intervention and control characteristics, and study results into standardized evidence tables. A second reviewer checked the data for accuracy. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by 2 reviewers independently using the USPSTF and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria.</p>
<p>EPC reviewers rated articles as good-, fair-, or poor-quality. Good-quality studies generally met all criteria, whereas fair-quality studies did not meet all criteria but had no known important limitation that could invalidate its results. Poor-quality studies had important limitations that were considered fatal flaws (for example, more than 40% attrition with or without differential attrition between intervention groups; lack of randomization with biased assignment of participants to intervention groups, often with differences in baseline characteristics or no reporting of baseline characteristics; per protocol analyses only; and very poor reporting about description of methods, which did not allow adequate assessment of quality); thus these studies were excluded from this review.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Because of the clinical heterogeneity across this body of evidence, EPC reviewers stratified the analyses according to the type of intervention (that is, a focus on dietary counseling alone, physical activity alone, or combined diet and physical activity counseling) and according to how study populations were targeted or defined (that is, dyslipidemia, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance, or mixed risk factors). They did random-effects meta-analyses for 5 or more studies using the DerSimonian-Laird method to estimate the effect size of counseling on intermediate health outcomes (that is, systolic and diastolic blood pressure; total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; triglycerides; fasting blood glucose; diabetes incidence; and weight or body mass index). EPC reviewers did qualitative synthesis for health outcomes, behavioral outcomes, and harms. Outcome analyses were also stratified by length of follow-up after randomization (short term was less than 12 months, intermediate term was 12 to 24 months, and long term was greater than 24 months).</p>
<p>EPC reviewers used stratified analyses, visual inspection of forest plots arranged by effect size, and/or meta-regressions to examine the effect of a priori-specified primary sources of heterogeneity on effect size: study population, intervention type, overall intervention intensity (low was less than 30 minutes of total contact, medium was 30 to 360 minutes, and high was more than 360 minutes), number of intervention contacts, duration of intervention, length of follow-up, overall study quality, year of publication, country setting, type of control group, and population risk (including average age; percentage of persons who smoke or have hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes; average systolic blood pressure; average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level; average body mass index; and use of medications).</p>
<p>EPC reviewers assessed the presence of statistical heterogeneity among the studies using standard chi-square tests, and the magnitude of heterogeneity was estimated using the <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic. In instances of 10 or more studies, they formally assessed for publication bias and whether the distribution of the effect sizes was symmetrical with respect to the precision measure by using funnel plots and the Egger linear regression method. EPC reviewers did all analyses using Stata, version 11.2.</p></div></p>

On the basis of this assessment, the USPSTF assigns a letter grade to each preventive service signifying its recommendation about provision of the service (see Table below). An important, but often challenging, step is determining the balance between benefits and harms to estimate "net benefit" (that is, benefits minus harms).</p>

<p>*<em>A, B, C, D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized, controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the USPSTF constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term certainty will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span>. Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send a draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response to Public Comment</span>. A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 13 May to 9 June 2014. Thirty-three comments were received. In response to these comments, the USPSTF clarified how this recommendation fits with related ones on healthy lifestyles and screening for obesity. It clarified the population under consideration throughout the recommendation statement and more explicitly defined the connections between the populations studied and the target population of the recommendation. The USPSTF also provided more detail on the evidence gap for CVD outcomes and added to the Research Needs and Gaps section. In addition, it added or updated several references and made other minor editorial changes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</span>. Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Sports Medicine, and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).</p></div></p>

The reduction in glucose levels was large enough to decrease the incidence of a diabetes diagnosis.

    <li>The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone.

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="/web/20180713034729/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=48483&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org%2f" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180713034729im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p>
