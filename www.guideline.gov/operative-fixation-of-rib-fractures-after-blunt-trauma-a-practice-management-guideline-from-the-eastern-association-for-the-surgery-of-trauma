<p>The systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO registry of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Registration No. CRD42014015575). Subsequently, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases were searched in duplicate by professional librarians from two medical schools (Boston University and Harvard University) on January 29, 2016. The following medical subject headings (MeSH) terms were included: <em>rib fracture, flail chest, fracture treatment, surgical management, fixation, plating, operative reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)</em> in various combinations (see the full strategy in the original guideline document). No restrictions were placed on language. The ranges for their literature search were from January 1900 to January 2016. Prospective trials and retrospective cohort/case-control studies that compared rib ORIF versus non-operative management of rib fractures in adults with either flail and/or non-flail chest patients were eligible for inclusion and were retrieved. Case reports, commentaries, and animal studies were excluded, as were studies describing operative technique alone, and reviews. The reference lists of retrieved papers were also screened to identify additional studies. For a study to be included in their final analysis, a clear comparison between operative versus non-operative subjects had to be present and at least one of the critical outcomes reported.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the electronic literature search, citation lists were independently reviewed by two authors to identify potentially relevant studies. Titles and abstracts were screened, and full articles were reviewed as needed. Any disagreement on inclusion was resolved by consensus (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document).</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcome Measures</span></strong></p>
<p>Numerous candidate outcomes (including in-hospital mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS; incidence of pneumonia; need for tracheostomy; pain control; lung volumes on spirometry; quality of life after discharge; exercise tolerance; chronic disability; and time away from work) were voted on independently by each author on a scale from 1 to 9 per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Outcomes with scores 7 to 9 were considered critical, those with scores 4 to 6 were considered important, and those with scores in the 1 to 3 range were considered of limited importance. After rounding to the nearest integer, outcomes with an average score of 7 or greater (considered to be critical) were included in the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions. The intervention, operative reduction and internal fixation of rib fractures (rib ORIF), was compared against non-operative management, as described earlier. Finally, patients were grouped into those with flail chest as defined by each reviewed manuscript although classically defined as those with three or more consecutive ribs fractured at 2 or more sites each, and those without flail chest pattern. The rounded average scores for each of the considered clinically relevant outcomes are summarized in Table 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>Data extraction from each study was performed using standardized data collection sheets and was performed in duplicate. Data extracted included authors; journal; publication year; country of origin; study design; whether patients with traumatic brain injury were excluded; patients' age, gender, and Injury Severity Scores; number of patients in the operative and non-operative arms; number of patients with flail and non-flail chest rib fracture patterns (if available); time from admission to operation (if available), and the critical outcomes previously outlined (including mean and standard deviation [SD] values for the continuous outcomes). Whenever only mean and <em>p</em> values were provided and no SDs for the continuous variables, the latter were calculated using the following formula: Standard Deviation (SD) = [(Mean Difference/<em>t</em>-Score)]/Square Root of (1/N1 + 1 N2), where the <em>t</em>-score was calculated for each outcome using the provided <em>p</em> value and each study's degrees of freedom. N1 and N2 represent the number of patients in the ORIF and non-operative groups, respectively. If no <em>p</em> value was provided but statistical significance was declared, the highest <em>p</em> value of the alpha error declared by the authors was used for the SD calculations (e.g., if statistical significance was declared at a two-tailed level of less than 0.05 and no exact <em>p</em> value was provided, it was assumed that the <em>p</em> value was 0.05). When a range was provided and no SD, the latter was calculated by subtracting the minimum from the maximum value and dividing by 4. Forest plots were generated and treatment effects calculated, with each study weighing proportionally to the number of subjects it contributed in each outcome analysis. Heterogeneity for the analysis of each outcome was calculated using &chi;2 (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified with <em>I&sup2;</em>. <em>I&sup2;</em> values less than 25% were considered to provide a low degree of heterogeneity; <em>I&sup2;</em> values in the 25% to 50% range moderately heterogeneous, and values greater than 50% were indicative of high heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Publication bias was evaluated using the Egger test, and the GRADE framework was applied to all quantified outcomes for assessment of bias, publication bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness. Analyses were performed with STATA, version 13.1 (Stata, College Station, TX), and all recommendations and their reported strengths were reviewed and agreed on by the entire authoring team. GRADEpro GDT (Cochrane Informatics &amp; Knowledge Management, Baltimore, MD) was used to generate evidence profile tables.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>One research group (n = 37; 18 patients underwent rib operative reduction and internal fixation [ORIF] and 19 non-operative management) conducted the first prospective randomized clinical trial including adult blunt trauma victims with severe flail chest on mechanical ventilation, unable to wean by post-injury Day 5. Patients with fewer than six fractured ribs; those with severe closed head injury (head Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] &gt;3) and/or spinal injury; with chronic preexisting heart, pulmonary, hepatic, and/or renal disease were excluded. Rib fixation afforded shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), lower incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy, and improved pain and subjective shortness of breath, all while hastening functional recovery. This study also demonstrated that these outcomes could be achieved with lower costs.</p>
<p>Another research group randomized 46 flail chest victims, if they were ventilator dependent with no prospect of successful weaning within the next 48 hours. Subjects older than 80 years, severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;10), spinal injuries precluding lateral decubitus positioning, and open rib fractures with soiling or infection were excluded. Patients undergoing rib fixation (n = 23) benefitted from shorter DMV and ICU LOS, as well as decreased need for postoperative non-invasive ventilation. These outcomes also accompanied significant cost savings, although no differences were noted in quality of life, spirometric findings, or activity levels at later follow-ups.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In one study, rib fixation afforded shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), lower incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy, and improved pain and subjective shortness of breath, all while hastening functional recovery. In another study, the group demonstrated reduced DMV, ICU LOS and hospital LOS, as well as lower incidence of pneumonia and chest wall deformity. Spirometry was also noted to be improved 2 months after injury. In a third study, patients undergoing rib fixation (n = 23) benefitted from shorter DMV and ICU LOS, as well as decreased need for postoperative noninvasive ventilation. These outcomes also accompanied significant cost savings, although no differences were noted in quality of life, spirometric findings, or activity levels at later follow-ups. </li>
    <li>Regarding the optimal timing of operative reduction and internal fixation (rib ORIF), it seems that patients enrolled in studies that offered surgery early (within 24&ndash;72 hours after injury) enjoyed shorter DMV, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS, as well as lower incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy, compared to those that were operated on later on (72 hours after injury). </li>
    <li>Although significant selection bias may exist, one study showed that patients who underwent rib ORIF had improved pain scores postoperatively and were able to return to baseline activity earlier. In another study, patients self-selected operative or conservative management. Those who underwent surgery had shorter DMV, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS; and their incidence of pulmonary infections, mortality, and need for tracheostomy was lower compared to their on operative counterparts. Pain control was also improved in the rib ORIF group. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Brain injury is associated with higher mortality rates, and afflicted subjects may not derive the full benefit of operative reduction and internal fixation of rib fractures (rib ORIF) owing to extrapulmonary reasons. Conversely, severe brain trauma victims may not be able to lie flat for lengthy chest operations in the presence of intracranial hypertension, and the risk-to-benefit ratio of chest wall reconstruction has to be carefully evaluated on an individual basis.</p>

    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad Hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
