                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature search #1 was performed in PubMed using broad terms (see the Appendix in the original guideline document), in order to identify systematic reviews, meta-analyses or relevant practice guidelines published subsequent to availability of the previous American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Practice Parameters. Examination of discovered papers (n=93) enabled elucidation of Practice Parameter recommendations requiring revisions, and also assisted with further refinement of the Patient, Population or Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions. Results from literature search #1 were not included in the systematic review and thus did not contribute to the recommendations in this guideline: the resulting literature was gathered for instructive purposes only, to help determine which recommendations warranted updating.</p>
<p>The next literature search (#2) targeted treatment trials involving intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) that addressed at least one PICO question. This search utilized PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Literature search #2 was conducted in July 2012, and searched for literature published from October 2006 through July 2012.</p>
<p>At least two Task Force (TF) members carefully assessed the abstract of each retrieved article (n=2,063), to determine whether the publication should be included for further consideration. The following list of general exclusion criteria was used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Diagnosis or not treatment </li>
    <li>CRSWD</li>
    <li>Not intrinsic CRSWD (shift work or jet-lag disorder) </li>
    <li>Wrong publication type (review, editorial, etc.) </li>
    <li>Not human subjects </li>
    <li>Mechanistic or methodological study </li>
    <li>Study was published before October 2006 </li>
</ol>
<p>When there were questions or disagreements, the full text of the article was reviewed in detail until consensus was reached. The same search terms, databases and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used for literature search #3, although new date limitations were applied (June, 2012&ndash;March, 2014), with the intention to capture articles published after completion of search #2. Four hundred fifty-three additional publications were retrieved, and TF assessments occurred in the same manner described above. Finally, TF members selected several literature reviews (by consensus), and screened reference lists to identify other articles of potential interest. This "pearling" process served as a "spot control" for the previous searches, and ensured that important articles were not missed. All duplicate references were eliminated.</p>
<p>Since new inclusion/exclusion criteria were used in this project, investigations cited in the previous Practice Parameters were not necessarily incorporated into the current analysis. Studies that did not meet inclusion criteria were selectively used for discussion purposes, but were neither included in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) reports nor used as a basis for recommendations. The TF made a particular effort to discuss those studies (containing either patients or healthy subjects) that might spur and/or improve future clinical research for the reviewed CRSWDs.</p>
<p>A final PubMed search was conducted to identify harms or adverse effects attributed to the relevant interventions: light therapy (PICO 4), hypnotics (PICO 5), and melatonin (PICO 6) (see the Appendix in the original guideline document). Limitations were imposed to select for English-language "meta-analyses" and "systematic reviews" pertaining to human subjects. The titles and abstracts of articles produced by these searches were reviewed for relevance, and pertinent publications were examined. Other cited articles from the "Harms and Adverse Effects" section in the original guideline document were culled from prior searches (but deemed ineligible for quantitative analysis) or were provided via TF members' preemptive awareness and consensus regarding relevancy. Adverse effects of combined treatments were addressed based on the singular components of combinations.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extraction of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Quantitative data pertaining to the outcomes of interest as well as information necessary for systematic evaluation and grading of the evidence were extracted from accepted articles using a dedicated spreadsheet. Articles determined to lack quantitative data or with data presented in a format incompatible with desired statistical analyses were rejected at this stage, but used selectively for further discussion. In instances where desired data were available but not presented in the desired format, the authors were contacted, and raw data were acquired if possible. Data were pooled across the studies for each outcome measure in accordance with Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) questions and based on diagnosis, study design, patient population, clinical outcome of interest, and method of derivation (e.g., polysomnography [PSG] derived data were analyzed separately from data derived from actigraphy or sleep diaries).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Analyses </span></strong></p>
<p>Meta-analyses were completed (in the few instances possible) using the random effects model. All computations were performed using the Review Manager software, and included calculations of the mean difference (MD) &plusmn; standard deviation (SD) for CRITICAL outcomes. Values analyzed in this manner are displayed to the hundredths place. Age demographics and information regarding melatonin doses are presented in the format provided by the associated study (mean &plusmn; SD if available) but, in an effort to maintain consistency, are displayed only to the tenths place in instances where the authors provided values with numerical place values of lower hierarchy. The results of meta-analyses are depicted in figures within the text, in association with a "forest plot." Summary of findings tables for all investigations are presented in the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>When studies contained placebo/control groups, the evaluation of the effect of treatment was performed by comparison of averaged posttreatment and averaged post-placebo/control group values, regardless of the authors' approaches. In studies with crossover or "before-after" designs where there was no placebo/control group, posttreatment values were compared to baseline values. Our use of this methodology occasionally produced results that differed from those reported in the original publications.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). In contrast to other methods, an estimate of effect is generated for critical outcomes across studies, as opposed to an evaluation of individual studies. Multiple aspects of quality of evidence are assessed, with downgrading of evidence as applicable (see Table 3 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The body of evidence for each outcome was assessed and graded, taking into account quality considerations based on the quantitative analysis and other major factors described above. CRITICAL outcome results are presented as summary of findings tables organized by PICO question and patient population (see the Appendix [Tables S1&ndash;S12] in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>A cumulative quality grade for a particular PICO question and patient population is predicated upon the <em>lowest</em> level of evidence assigned to one of the CRITICAL outcomes. Thus, if a recommendation was based upon two outcomes, one of moderate and one of low quality, the overall grade would be low.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expert Task Force</span></strong></p>
<p>In order to develop these Clinical Practice Guidelines, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a Task Force (TF) of four members with expertise in the field of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs), appointed an AASM Board of Directors (BOD) liaison, and assigned an AASM Science and Research Department staff member to manage the project. The Task Force performed an extensive review of the scientific literature and assessed the available evidence employing the methodology of evidence-based medicine (specifically, meta-analysis and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system [GRADE]) to draft recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Eight PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) questions were developed, based on both the inquiries raised in the previous AASM publications and an investigation of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and guidelines published subsequently (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). The AASM BOD ultimately approved these questions. In addition, combination treatments were also reviewed for the four intrinsic CRSWDs included in this guideline.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The TF developed recommendation statements and determined the strengths of these recommendations based on the balance of the following major factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Level of evidence&mdash;based on an assessment of the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria (see Table 3 in the original guideline document), the TF categorized the evidence as:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>High </li>
        <li>Moderate </li>
        <li>Low </li>
        <li>Very Low </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Benefits vs. Harms&mdash;based upon CRITICAL outcomes and analysis of any harms/side effects, the TF assessed whether:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Benefits outweighed harms </li>
        <li>Benefits equaled harms </li>
        <li>Harms outweighed benefits </li>
        <li>The balance between benefits and harms was unclear </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Patient values and preferences&mdash;based on the clinical expertise of the TF and relevant published data, including discussion in the referenced papers about tolerability, compliance, and patients' experiences with the treatments in question, the TF judged whether:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">

<p>Taking these variables into consideration, each recommendation statement was given a "strength value" of Strong For, Weak For, Weak Against or Strong Against (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). As an example, a body evidence could be rated VERY LOW, while another could be rated MODERATE, and yet both could generate a WEAK FOR recommendation, based upon the above mentioned factors.</p>
<p>There were multiple cases when the TF chose to make "No Recommendation," which reflects either a complete lack of available evidence (no studies were published) or situations when evidence was available but either did not meet review inclusion criteria or was considered insufficient to support a recommendation (see the Appendix [Tables S5 and S6] in the original guideline document). It needs to be emphasized that "No Recommendation" does not mean that treatments should not be tried but that, in the absence of sufficient and conclusive evidence, clinicians should use their best judgment to decide in each particular case whether or not a treatment should be used. At the step of review of the extracted evidence, the TF made a decision to exclude studies with fewer than 10 subjects if the study constituted a single source of evidence, as it was felt that affiliated data were insufficient to support a recommendation.</p></div></p>
