                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Question Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Champions were tasked with identifying key evidence questions to guide the systematic review of the literature on rehabilitation management of upper extremity amputation. These questions, which were developed in consultation with Lewin and ECRI Institute, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) populations regarding upper extremity amputation rehabilitation (UEAR). The key questions follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A-1 in the original guideline document provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology.</p>
<p>The Champions and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Table A-2 in the original guideline document&nbsp;contains the final set of key questions used to guide the systematic review for the CPG.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>The methods guiding this systematic review are described below. In part, these methods follow the guidelines for conducting a systematic review set forth by the AHRQ in the <em>Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews</em>. The methods also follow the guidance set forth by the VA/DoD <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em> document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The systematic review of the literature consisted of several distinct steps, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Defining the inclusion and exclusion search criteria </li>
    <li>Developing a search strategy (i.e., search logic using MeSH [Medical Subject Headings] terminology and key words) </li>
    <li>Screening the results based on abstracts and titles (i.e., identifying relevant studies and excluding duplicate records) </li>
    <li>Reviewing the full text of remaining studies and abstracting relevant data points (i.e., population, comparator, results, etc.) </li>
    <li>Assessing the internal and external validity of abstracted studies </li>
    <li>Summarizing the evidence </li>
    <li>Interpreting the results </li>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>The evidence from each included study was abstracted into evidence tables and narratively synthesized. This guideline focuses primarily on the following patient-centered outcomes: independence in activities of daily living (ADL), prosthetic use, prosthetic satisfaction, satisfaction with body image and/or cosmesis, residual or phantom pain, quality of life, satisfaction with life, depression and other mood disorders, incidence of complications, reintegration, and return to work. The strength of the evidence was assessed along the following criteria: methodological quality, consistency of findings across studies, directness of the evidence (e.g., head-to-head comparisons provide the most direct evidence), and precision (i.e., the degree of certainty around an outcome's effect size).</p>
<p>Overall, the evidence base for this guideline consisted of 43 studies. The majority of the evidence addressed strategies to treat postoperative phantom and residual limb pain. A fair amount of evidence considered factors associated with successful, long-term prosthetic use at one or more years following rehabilitation. Very few studies considered rehabilitation at the pre-prosthetic or prosthetic training phase. Inconsistencies of the evidence are discussed in the text describing the basis of a recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Assessment</strong></p>
<p>In order for the clinician to be aware of the evidence base behind the recommendations and the weight that should be given to each recommendation, the recommendations are keyed according to the level of confidence with which each recommendation is made. The graded recommendations are based on two main dimensions: 1) net benefit of an intervention and 2) certainty of evidence associated with that net benefit. When evidence is limited, the level of confidence also incorporates clinical consensus with regard to a particular clinical decision.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The methodology used in developing this 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) follows the <em>Guideline for Guidelines</em>, an internal document of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence-Based Practice Working Group (EBPWG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development of a upper extremity amputation rehabilitation (UEAR) CPG.</p>
<p>The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare system. Specifically, the Champions for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions of greatest clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management of patients with upper extremity amputations. In addition, the Champions assisted in:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review </li>
    <li>Assessing the level and quality of the evidence </li>
    <li>Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group </li>
    <li>Directing and coordinating the Work Group </li>
    <li>Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes </li>
</ol>
<p>The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, US Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified five clinical leaders as Champions for the 2014 CPG.</p>
<p>The Lewin Team (team), including Duty First Consulting and ECRI Institute, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The team held the first conference call in October 2012, with participation from the contracting officer's representatives (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, the project team discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review about the management of UEAR. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of UEAR, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: Internal Medicine, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physiatry, Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy, Prosthetics, Psychology, Recreational Therapy, Social Work and Surgery.</p>
<p>The guideline development process for the 2014 CPG update consisted of the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Formulating evidence questions (Key Questions) </li>
    <li>Conducting the systematic review </li>
    <li>Convening a face-to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members </li>
    <li>Drafting and submitting a final CPG about the management of UEAR to the VA/DoD EBPWG </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations presented in this CPG are based on a systematic appraisal of the published evidence on the rehabilitation and management of Veterans and Service Members with acquired upper extremity amputation. In areas where the evidence is particularly lacking, expert opinion served as the basis for the recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>In order for the clinician to be aware of the evidence base behind the recommendations and the weight that should be given to each recommendation, the recommendations are keyed according to the level of confidence with which each recommendation is made. The graded recommendations are based on two main dimensions: 1) net benefit of an intervention and 2) certainty of evidence associated with that net benefit. When evidence is limited, the level of confidence also incorporates clinical consensus with regard to a particular clinical decision.</p>
<p><strong>Grade of EO for Experts Opinion</strong></p>
<p>To grade the recommendations for the guideline, the CPG Working Group used a variation of the USPSTF grading framework to provide for a grade of EO for "Expert Opinion." Given that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have to be used in real practice for Veterans and Service Members, a grade of I for insufficient evidence may not provide useful guidance for supporting clinical decisions in practice. In particular, the guideline developers considered certain instances in which evidence suggests a Substantial or Moderate net benefit, but the certainty/strength of that evidence is Low. In those instances, rather than concluding that the evidence is insufficient to support a clinical decision, the guideline developers relied on expert opinion to set forth a recommendation. A grade of EO does not imply that the evidence is strong (it is still Low). However, it does suggest that the magnitude of net benefit (Substantial or Moderate) is of sufficient clinical importance to make a recommendation, even if it is based on low certainty (weak evidence).</p>
<p>This CPG represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and clinical practice on the management of upper limb amputation rehabilitation. It attempts to be as free as possible of bias toward any theoretical or empirical approach to treatment.</p>
<p>This CPG is the product of many months of diligent effort and consensus building among knowledgeable individuals from the VHA and the DoD. An experienced moderator facilitated the multidisciplinary Working Group. An experienced moderator facilitated the multidisciplinary Working Group. The draft document was discussed in a face-to-face group meeting. The content and validity of each section was thoroughly reviewed in a series of conference calls.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patient Engagement</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations included in this guideline are patient-centric. In an effort to ensure that the patient is at the core of any clinical decision, the Work Group identified a group of individuals from within the VA and DoD with upper limb amputations. Approximately 10 patients, currently receiving care from the VA and/or DoD health systems, were invited to join the Work Group for a discussion on their experiences. These individuals represented different age groups, sexes, race/ethnicities, and had various causes of upper limb loss. The group consisted of non-combat veterans who underwent elective and non-elective upper limb amputations as well as combat veterans from Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.</p>
<p>The Work Group developed a set of concise, thought-provoking questions in an effort to gather insights on each person's care and rehabilitation experience. These questions included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>How critical do you feel your care team was to your rehabilitation? </li>
    <li>How were options for treatment presented to you throughout your care? </li>
    <li>To what extent did you feel empowered to make treatment decisions? </li>
    <li>Throughout each phase of your care, how often did you have contact with any member of your care team? </li>
    <li>How could your care and rehabilitation process have been improved? </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Work Group reviewed each practice recommendation with the participants in order to identify and address any potential gaps within the CPG. The discussion that ensued was fairly informal and designed to gather information about the patient's experience with their primary care providers and care team throughout their rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Several key insights were gleaned from this discussion and subsequently used to refine and clarify the guideline recommendations. In particular, participants noted that an interdisciplinary care team approach, shared decision making, and education on emerging prosthetic technologies are critical to improving the patient experience during and following rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Several participants indicated that while they have been generally satisfied with their primary care providers, rehabilitation providers, or prosthetists, a truly comprehensive care team approach was essential but occasionally missing, in which all or most members of the team are fully abreast of the patient's progress and engaged in all aspects of his or her care. The Work Group used this information to further emphasize the importance of the care team and outlined the various individuals that should be involved, including the patient's family and/or caregivers.</p>
<p>Participants also described the importance of utilizing a shared decision making model, which allows providers and patients to identify rehabilitations goals, assess prosthetic needs, and make treatment decisions together. Some of the older participants explained that historically, very little was discussed in terms of goal setting between themselves and their providers. Often, rehabilitation and training, both with and without prosthesis, was primarily achieved through trial and error over time, rather than during the rehabilitation process. Today, shared decision making is more frequently used in a clinical setting, particularly due to VA and DoD commitment to providing patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Finally, participants expressed concern over a lack of communication between patients and providers regarding education and information on emerging prosthetic technologies. Several individuals noted that most of the information they receive comes from indirect sources (i.e., other people with amputations), rather than from their providers. The Work Group incorporated this feedback into the lifelong care phase.</p>
<p>Participants for this discussion were identified and recruited by the CPG Work Group. Participants received modest compensation for their travel. The Work Group noted the value in incorporating patients during the development of this guideline and suggested that other CPG Work Groups follow this model.</p></div></p>

    <li>Patients undergoing upper extremity amputation are at risk for complications including venous thrombosis, embolism, heterotopic ossification, joint contracture, and pressure ulcers. </li>
    <li>Acceptance and function of upper extremity prostheses by the patient is always at risk. The risk for disuse or rejection is even greater if the patient does not have a good understanding of the operation and control of the prosthetic device. </li>
    <li>Patients with amputations are at risk for secondary complications in the residual and non-amputated limb. The development of overuse syndromes and other painful musculoskeletal conditions frequently occurs in patients with upper limb amputations. </li>
    <li>There are several different types of pain experienced after amputation including immediate post-surgical pain and post-amputation pain, which includes residual limb pain, phantom limb pain, and associated musculoskeletal pain. </li>
    <li>Patients receiving medication to control pain are at risk of side effects and complications associated with narcotic pain medications. </li>
    <li>Patients with amputations are at risk of requiring revision surgery for the amputated extremity or amputation of other extremities. </li>
    <li>Long-term prosthetic use commonly results in complications such as skin breakdown and pain. </li>
    <li>Myoelectric control signals will be adversely affected if the prosthesis socket is too tight or becomes too loose due to changes in limb volume or soft tissue composition. </li>
