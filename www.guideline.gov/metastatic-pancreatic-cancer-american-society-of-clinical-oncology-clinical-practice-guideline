                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based, Formal consensus, Informal consensus, No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>After a histopathologic confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis, what initial assessment is recommended before initiating any therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>. A multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed to assess extent of disease. Other staging studies should be performed only as dictated by symptoms (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>. The baseline performance status (PS), symptom burden, and comorbidity profile of a patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer should be evaluated carefully (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>. The goals of care (which include a discussion of an advance directive), patient preferences, and support systems should be discussed with every patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer and his or her caregivers (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>. Multidisciplinary collaboration to formulate treatment and care plans and disease management for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer should be the standard of care (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.5</em>. Every patient with pancreatic cancer should be offered information about clinical trials, which include therapeutic trials in all lines of treatment as well as palliative care, biorepository/biomarker, and observational studies (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate first-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>. Leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is recommended for patients who meet all of the following criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS 0 to 1, favorable comorbidity profile, patient preference and support system for aggressive medical therapy, and access to chemotherapy port and infusion pump management services (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>. Gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound (NAB)-paclitaxel is recommended for patients who meet all of the following criteria: ECOG PS 0 to 1, relatively favorable comorbidity profile, and patient preference and support system for relatively aggressive medical therapy (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.3</em>. Gemcitabine alone is recommended for patients who have either an ECOG PS 2 or a comorbidity profile that precludes more-aggressive regimens and who wish to pursue cancer-directed therapy. The addition of either capecitabine or erlotinib to gemcitabine may be offered in this setting (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.4</em>. Patients with an ECOG PS &ge;3 or with poorly controlled comorbid conditions despite ongoing active medical care should be offered cancer-directed therapy on only a case-by-case basis. The major emphasis should be on optimizing supportive care measures (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate therapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who experience either disease progression or intolerable toxicity with prior regimens for metastatic pancreatic cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>. Gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel can be offered as second-line therapy for patients who meet all of the following criteria: first-line treatment with FOLFIRINOX, ECOG PS 0 to 1, relatively favorable comorbidity profile, and patient preference and a support system for aggressive medical therapy (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>. Fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or nanoliposomal irinotecan can be offered as second-line therapy for patients who meet all of the following criteria: first-line treatment with gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel, ECOG PS 0 to 1, relatively favorable comorbidity profile, patient preference and a support system for aggressive medical therapy, and chemotherapy port and infusion pump management (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>. Gemcitabine or fluorouracil can be considered as second-line therapy for patients who have either an ECOG PS of 2 or a comorbidity profile that precludes more-aggressive regimens and who wish to pursue cancer-directed therapy (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4</em>. No data are available to recommend third-line (or greater) therapy with a cytotoxic agent. Clinical trial participation is encouraged (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>When should the concept of palliative care be introduced?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.1</em>. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer should have a full assessment of symptom burden, psychological status, and social supports as early as possible, preferably at the first visit. In most cases, this assessment will indicate a need for a formal palliative care consult and services (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><storng/>For patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, what are the recommended strategies for relief of pain and symptoms?</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer should be offered aggressive treatment of the pain and symptoms of the cancer and/or the cancer-directed therapy (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the recommended frequency of follow-up care/surveillance for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.1</em>. For patients on active cancer-directed therapy outside a clinical trial, imaging to assess first response should be offered at 2 to 3 months from the initiation of therapy. CT scans with contrast are the preferred modality. Thereafter, clinical assessment conducted frequently during visits for cancer-directed therapy should supplant imaging assessment. The routine use of positron emission tomography scans for the management of patients with pancreatic cancer is not recommended. Cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 is not considered an optimal substitute for imaging for assessing treatment response (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.2</em>. No data exist on the duration of cancer-directed therapy. An ongoing discussion of goals of care and assessment of treatment response and tolerability should guide decisions to continue or hold/terminate cancer-directed therapy (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The recommendations were developed by the multidisciplinary Expert Panel using a systematic review of articles in English (April 2002 to June 2015) of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of chemotherapy alone and/or chemoradiotherapy and/or compared with a control arm. Other peer-reviewed articles were used to inform the recommendations on palliative care, patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, and clinician communication as well as the section on health disparities. Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; and published in a non-English language.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The searches of the English-language literature published from January 2000 to June 2015 combined pancreatic neoplasm terms and follow-up-related terms and MeSH headings. Results of the databases searches were supplemented with hand searching of the bibliographies of systematic reviews and selected seminal articles, and contributions from Expert Panel members' personal files.</p>
<p>Details of the literature search strategy are provided in Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by two American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewers in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by two staff reviewers and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study design aspects related to individual study quality, strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and risk of bias were assessed and are shown in Data Supplement 1, Table 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The study quality was high for this group of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed with respect to factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, and so on, which generally indicated a low potential risk of bias for most of the identified evidence. Follow-up times varied among studies, which decreases the comparability of the results. Refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field for definitions of ratings for overall potential risk of bias.</p></div></p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met via webinar on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&trade;. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Implications</span></strong></p>
<p>Limited cost-effectiveness analyses exist with regard to the various treatment modalities used in the multidisciplinary management of metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, the available data appear to support the recommendations in this guideline. One study assessed the cost-effectiveness of first-line FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) compared with first-line gemcitabine for public payers in Canada. Compared with first-line gemcitabine, first-line FOLFIRINOX resulted in more life-years and quality-adjusted life-years. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results showed that for analyses 1 and 2, respectively, FOLFIRINOX has a &gt;85% probability and an approximately 80% probability of being cost-effective at the $100,000 threshold. Compared with gemcitabine, first-line FOLFIRINOX significantly prolongs median overall survival (OS). Given the favorable cost per quality-adjusted life-year, the improvement in clinical efficacy, and the limited available treatment options, FOLFIRINOX represents an attractive cost-effective treatment.</p>
<p>As reported at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, investigators compared the costs and clinical outcomes of gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound (NAB)-paclitaxel versus erlotinib plus gemcitabine (E/G) by using drug cost per cycle multiplied by the median cycles delivered from clinical trials for gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel and E/G. The comparison included the cost of the drugs as well as expenses related to the administration of the therapy and the management of adverse effects (AEs) of grade 3/4 severity. These costs were based on 4 months of therapy for gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel versus 3.9 months for E/G as administered at a large, multisite oncology clinic. The researchers found that the total cost for gemcitabine plus NAB paclitaxel was $24,984 versus $23,044 for E/G. However, the gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel is expected to deliver a greater survival benefit based on clinical trial data, bringing the cost per life-year gained to $15,522.</p>
<p>Moreover, health care experts have noted that the costs of treatment are high and increasing. The choice of therapy depends on a variety of clinical factors. More than 70% of cases are diagnosed in patients age 65 years and older. Thus, in the United States, Medicare pays for a substantial portion of associated costs. The costs of treating the malignancy are noteworthy when one considers that pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.</p></div></p>

All members of the panel completed ASCO's disclosure form, which requires disclosure of financial and other interests, including relationships with commercial entities that are reasonably likely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impact as a result of promulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; stock or other ownership; honoraria, consulting or advisory role; speaker's bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, expenses; and other relationships.
