<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between January 2009 and March 2015. The resulting list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites and recommendations from the literature. Furthermore, expert panel members were asked to suggest additional guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles published in English between October 2009 and April 2015 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), EMBASE, and PsycINFO; Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) was used for question three only. In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available in the guideline search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, two RNAO nursing research associates (nurses holding master's degrees) independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Any disagreements at this stage were resolved through tie-breaking by the project manager.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong></p>
<p>Panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify key articles not found through the above search strategies. Articles identified by panel members were included in the search results if two nursing research associates independently determined the articles had not been identified by the literature search and met the inclusion criteria.</p></div></p>

<p>The Best Practice Guideline (BPG) program manager and nursing research associates appraised 21 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em> (Brouwers et al., 2010).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Quality appraisal scores for 24 articles (a random sample of approximately 20 percent of the total articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) nursing research associates. Quality appraisal was assessed using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews; see <a href="/web/20180712184633/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50477&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2famstar.ca%2findex.php" title="AMSTAR Web site">http://amstar.ca/index.php</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712184633im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>) and RNAO's scoring system that rates reviews as weak, moderate, or strong, depending on their quality scores. The nursing research associates reached acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, &kappa;=0.81), which justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction for the remaining studies. The remaining studies were divided equally between the two research associates for quality appraisal and data extraction. A final narrative summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and narrative summary were provided to all expert panel members for review and discussion.</p>
<p>A complete bibliography of all full text articles screened for inclusion is available (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div></p>

<p>For this guideline, Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas (see the "Composition of the Group That Authored the Guideline" field). A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope, and was supported by the four research questions listed below. The systematic review captured relevant peer-reviewed literature and guidelines published between January 2009 and March 2015.The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the most effective ways for nurses to screen or assess older adults for delirium, dementia, and depression? </li>
    <li>What are the most effective approaches for management of older adults with delirium, dementia, and depression? </li>
    <li>What education and training strategies (taught in basic curricula, advanced practice education or ongoing professional development programs) do nurses need to be effective during the assessment and management of older adults with delirium, dementia, and/or depression? </li>
    <li>What organizational policies and structures are required to enable nurses to assess and manage older adults with delirium, dementia, and/or depression? </li>
</ol>
<p>This guideline is the result of the RNAO guideline development team and expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence, and ensure the validity, appropriateness, and safety of the guideline recommendations with supporting evidence and/or expert panel consensus.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Stakeholder reviewers for the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guidelines are identified in two ways. First, stakeholders are recruited through a public call issued on the RNAO Web site (<a href="/web/20180712184633/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=50477&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2frnao.ca%2fbpg%2fget-involved%2fstakeholder" title="RNAO Web site">http://rnao.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712184633im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). Second, key individuals and organizations with expertise in the guideline topic area are identified by the RNAO guideline development team and expert panel and are directly invited to participate in the review.</p>
<p>Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholder feedback is submitted online by completing a survey questionnaire. The stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Is this recommendation clear? </li>
    <li>Do you agree with this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Is the discussion of evidence thorough and does the evidence support the recommendation? </li>
</ul>
<p>The survey also provides an opportunity to include comments and feedback for each section of the guideline.</p>
<p>Survey submissions are compiled and feedback is summarized by the RNAO guideline development team. The RNAO development team and expert panel review and consider all feedback and, if necessary, modify the guideline content and recommendations prior to publication to address the feedback received.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Early recognition of delirium, dementia, and/or depression can lead to timely structured assessments, diagnosis, treatment, and care. </li>
    <li>A meta-analysis, rated strong in methodological quality, reported that multi-component interventions to prevent delirium caused a relative reduction of 30 percent in incident delirium (i.e., delirium that develops while a person is hospitalized). In addition to preventing delirium, multi-component, non-pharmacological interventions have been found to prevent falls, to potentially help reduce the length of stay for those in acute care, and may help avoid institutionalization. </li>
    <li>Effective communication enhances positive behaviour, promotes more satisfying interactions, and improves overall quality of life for a person with dementia. Effective communication has also been shown to reduce agitation and responsive behaviours in persons with dementia and promote the person's dignity and sense of control. </li>
    <li>Cognitive interventions can be described as activities that teach new ways of carrying out cognitive tasks, and strategies to improve functioning or restore abilities in specific domains. </li>
    <li>Although most of the evidence is methodologically weak, one strong systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that educational interventions for caregivers in the community decreased caregiver burden and depression. Other potential benefits may include reduced caregiver depression, reduced caregiver burden, enhanced caregiver well-being, improved quality of life, improved knowledge, improved coping skills or the ability to manage symptoms of dementia, and enhanced interactions with the person with dementia. </li>
    <li>Table 2 in the original guideline document lists benefits of non-pharmacological approaches to management of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). </li>
</ul></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Potential Harms</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The guideline points out the following potential harms associated with certain medications and the use of restraints:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medications (e.g., psychoactive medications and sedative-hypnotics) and polypharmacy contribute to an increased risk of delirium; they may also prolong delirium or cause excessive sedation. An increased risk exists when the medications are used with frail, older adults. </li>
    <li>Some medications (e.g., steroids) may be associated with major depression. </li>
    <li>One research group found that although antipsychotic and sedating medications may reduce agitation and behavioural symptoms, it is possible that the use of these medications may prolong delirium or convert hyperactive delirium into hypoactive delirium. </li>
    <li>Among people with depression who are at risk for suicide, potential drug interactions and toxicity in overdose of antidepressants and/or other medications should be considered, and the amount of drugs available limited (as required). </li>
    <li>In general, antipsychotic medications may increase the risk of adverse effects&mdash;for example, cerebrovascular events and death. </li>
    <li>Physical restraints are associated with an increased risk of delirium. </li>

    <li>This nursing Best Practice Guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document that provides resources for evidence-based nursing practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision-making for nurses and other health-care providers working with older adults who have delirium, dementia, and/or depression. The guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of individual organizations or practice settings and the needs and preferences of persons and their families accessing the health system for care and services. In addition, the guideline offers an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. </li>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Implementation Strategy</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines for practice to change. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2nd ed.; 2012) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see Appendix L in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of the Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). The RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs </li>
    <li>Nursing order sets, which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments </li>
    <li>The Best Practice Spotlight Organization&reg; (BPSO&reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs&reg; focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, the RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation annually.</p>
