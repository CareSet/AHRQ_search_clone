<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Classification of Patient Risk</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Assessing Patient Risk</strong></p>
<p>Assess whether a patient taking anti-resorptive or anti-angiogenic drugs is at low risk or higher risk of developing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) based on their medical condition, type and duration of drug therapy and any other complicating factors and record this in the patient's clinical notes. (<strong>Strong recommendation; low quality evidence</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Managing Patients at Risk of MRONJ</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Initial Management of Patients at Risk of MRONJ</strong></p>
<p>Before commencement of anti-resorptive or anti-angiogenic drug therapy, or as soon as possible thereafter, aim to get the patient as dentally fit as feasible, prioritising preventive care. Higher risk cancer patients should preferably undergo a thorough dental assessment, with remedial dental treatment where required, prior to commencement of the drug therapy. (<strong>Strong recommendation; low quality evidence</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Continuing Management of Patients at Risk of MRONJ</strong></p>
<p>Carry out all routine dental treatment as normal and continue to provide personalised preventive advice in primary care. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Perform straightforward extractions and other bone-impacting treatments in low risk patients in primary care. </li>
    <li>Adopt a more conservative approach in higher risk patients, giving greater consideration to other, less invasive alternative treatment options before performing extractions and other bone-impacting treatments in primary care. </li>
</ul>
<p>Do not prescribe antibiotic or antiseptic prophylaxis following extractions or other bone-impacting treatments specifically to reduce the risk of MRONJ. (<strong>Strong recommendation; low quality evidence</strong>)</p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The development of Oral Health Management of Patients at Risk of Medication-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw followed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) accredited methodology described in the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) Guidance Development Process Manual (Version 1.3., February 2016). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Literature Search</strong></span></p>
<p>The guiding principle for developing guidance within the SDCEP is to first source existing guidelines, policy documents, legislation or other recommendations. Similarly, relevant systematic reviews are also initially identified. These documents are appraised for their quality of development, evidence base and applicability to the remit of the guidance under development. In the absence of these documents or when supplementary information is required, other published literature and unpublished work may be sought. </p>
<p>For this guidance, a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, CANCERLIT, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was conducted by the Trials Search Coordinator of the Cochrane Oral Health Group on the 1st June 2015. No date limits were applied. The details of the searches can be found in Appendix 2 in the Guidance Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Following de-duplication, a total of 1160 records were retrieved. </p>
<p>Potentially eligible articles were identified separately by two reviewers from the list of titles and abstracts retrieved by the dental specific search. An article was considered potentially eligible if it met all of the following criteria: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The article was a systematic review or a guideline. An article would be included as a systematic review, if it included a methods section, a search of 1 or more electronic databases and a table of included studies. An article was included as a guideline if it made recommendations for clinical practice. </li>
    <li>The article referred to (i) anti-resorptive or anti-angiogenic drugs and (ii) osteonecrosis of the jaw in the context of dental treatment. </li>
</ol>
<p>Copies of all potentially eligible articles in full were retrieved. Additional manual searching of guideline repositories and other resources, and follow up of citations from relevant articles found through the systematic searching was also carried out. Other sources of evidence identified by guidance development group (GDG) members were also considered, taking relevance and methodological quality into account. To ensure that the final version of the guidance included the most up-to-date evidence, the literature search was repeated during the consultation and peer review processes to identify any relevant articles published between June 2015 and August 2016. Following de-duplication, a total of 173 records were retrieved. Any relevant new evidence was considered by the GDG prior to publication.</p></div></p>

<p>Eligible articles relevant for each of the key clinical questions were identified. Precedence was given to the most recent articles, where of suitable quality, published in English. A reviewer assessed the full text of each article and extracted the information applicable to the clinical question. The evidence appraisal form for each of the relevant articles can be found in Appendix 4 of the Guidance Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </p>
<p>For the development of this guidance the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess and rate the quality of evidence (<a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gradeworkinggroup.org" title="GRADE Working Group Web site">www.gradeworkinggroup.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). The GRADE framework is a widely accepted system for grading both the evidence and the recommendations, and is used internationally by other guideline producers. </p>
<p>After systematic consideration of several criteria, a GRADE 'quality of evidence' rating was assigned to the evidence relevant to each clinical question. GRADE evidence ratings are defined by the GRADE working group as in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p>
<p>The GRADE evidence ratings for the outcomes from each of the systematic reviews are recorded in the considered judgement forms in Appendix 3 and&nbsp;in the respective evidence appraisal forms (Appendix 4)(see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </p>
<p>For guidelines, the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument was used in addition to GRADE to assess the methodological quality of the retrieved articles (<a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">www.agreetrust.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). The AGREE II instrument is a simple and validated assessment tool that provides an overall quality score for each guideline and an indication of how reliable the guideline might be. These assigned scores are recorded in the evidence appraisal forms in Appendix 4. The output forms produced by the AGREE II tool used for assessing guidelines are available on request.</p></div></p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Development and Presentation of the Guidance Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>To develop the recommendations for this guidance, Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) convened a multidisciplinary guidance development group including medical and dental practitioners and specialists along with patient representatives. The key recommendations presented in the guidance were developed through considered judgements, made by the group, based on existing guidelines, the available evidence, clinical experience, expert opinion and patient and practitioner perspectives. Details of these considered judgements are available at <a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sdcep.org.uk" title="Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) ">www.sdcep.org.uk</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. The impact of potential barriers identified during guidance development and through stakeholder involvement and external consultation was also considered when formulating the recommendations. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The process for the development of recommendations followed the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gradeworkinggroup.org" title="GRADE Working Group Web site">www.gradeworkinggroup.org</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). The strength of each key recommendation is stated directly after the recommendation with a brief justification in the accompanying text. Strength of recommendation is not automatically dictated by evidence quality. Other factors, such as applicability, consistency and balance of benefits and harms are considered when forming recommendations and it is possible to make a strong recommendation where the evidence base is considered weak. A strong recommendation is one where it is considered, based on all the available information and weighing up the balance of benefits versus risk, that almost all individuals would choose this option. A conditional recommendation is one where there is a finer balance between the options and it is likely that the majority but not all would choose the recommended option. In the case of a conditional recommendation, the practitioner should expect to spend more time discussing the management options so that the patient can make an informed decision. Further details can be found in Appendix 1 in the original guideline document and at <a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sdcep.org.uk" title="SDCEP Web site">www.sdcep.org.uk</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>. </p>
<p>Other clinical practice advice in the guidance is based on consensus, expert opinion and existing best practice as identified in the accompanying text. These advice points are indicated with molar bullet points in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Clinical Questions</span></strong> </p>
<p>Key clinical questions relevant to the scope of the guidance were drafted by the SDCEP Programme Development Team (PDT) along with the GDG chair (see the Guidance Development Methodology document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). These were further discussed and agreed by the wider GDG. These key clinical questions informed the strategy for the systematic evidence searches.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Considered Judgements and Development of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The synthesised evidence for each clinical question was summarised and used to inform and facilitate the development of the recommendations for the guidance. Where authoritative evidence was unavailable, the guidance development group (GDG) was asked to make recommendations based on current best practice and expert opinion, reached by consensus. </p>
<p>The process for development of recommendations followed the GRADE approach, with considered judgements based on the quality of evidence, the balance of risks and benefits, the values and preferences of the patients, and the practicalities of the treatment. The relative importance of each of these criteria for a given recommendation was decided by the GDG.</p>
<p>The evidence summaries, GDG consideration of the criteria and the resulting outcomes for each key recommendation are recorded in the Considered Judgement Forms (one for each key clinical question) which can be found in Appendix 3 in the Guidance Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Some of the recommendations were subject to further review and revisions by the group during the guidance development process.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consultation and Peer Review</strong></span></p>
<p>A twelve-week external consultation process on the draft guidance was initiated on July 11th 2016. The consultation draft was made openly available through the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) Web site and notification of this was sent to a wide range of individuals and organisations with a specific interest in this topic, in addition to professional bodies and charities representing patient groups. All dentists and pharmacists in Scotland were notified that the consultation draft was available for comment. To encourage feedback from the end-users of the guidance, 50 randomly selected dentists were contacted directly to evaluate the guidance. Additionally, interviews were arranged with dentists and pharmacists to further inform the guidance development. </p>
<p>A consultation feedback form was provided to facilitate the process. All comments received were compiled, considered carefully by the guidance development group (GDG) and the guidance amended accordingly prior to publication. The compiled consultation comments and GDG responses are available on request. </p>
<p>Targeted external peer review was also conducted as a means of additional quality assurance. External experts, including experts in the field, representatives of professional bodies and those with a background in the methodology of guidance development/evidence appraisal, were approached and asked to comment on the applicability and suitability of the guidance to the intended audience (predominantly primary dental care in Scotland) and to indicate whether they think the process used to develop the guidance was satisfactory. This process took place over a four-week period in August and September 2016 and all peer reviewers were asked to complete a Declaration of Interests form. </p>
<p>As with the feedback received during the open consultation, comments received during targeted external expert review were compiled and considered by the GDG to inform further development of the guidance. The compiled peer review comments and GDG responses are available on request.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is an adverse drug reaction and as such is monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (<a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mhra.gov.uk" title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Web site">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). If a patient has suspected MRONJ, dental practitioners are encouraged to notify the MHRA via the Yellow Card Scheme (<a href="/web/20180712203454/https://www.guideline.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51142&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fyellowcard.mhra.gov.uk%2f" title="Yellow Card Scheme Web site">yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180712203454im_/https://www.guideline.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/>). Reporting is important to help the MHRA assess additional risk factors and identify drugs not previously associated with MRONJ. Duplicate reporting, for example by clinicians in both primary and secondary care, does not lead to over-estimation of incidence as duplicate reports are identified and can add value to the overall information on a suspected adverse drug reaction. Reporting is confidential and patients should also be encouraged to report via the scheme. </li>
    <li>Dental treatments that impact on bone, such as extractions, may increase the risk of MRONJ, therefore all possible alternatives should be considered to avoid extractions where possible. However, there will be cases where extraction is the only treatment option. </li>
    <li>Due to the increasing incidence of bacterial resistance and the numerous side effects associated with antibiotic therapy, antibiotics should only be prescribed where there is clear evidence that patients will benefit from them. </li>

<p>All contributors to the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP), including members of the guidance development group (GDG), are required to complete an SDCEP Declaration of Interests form to disclose relevant interests including financial conflicts of interest, such as receipt of fees for consulting with industry, and intellectual conflicts of interest, such as publication of original data bearing directly on a recommendation. These forms are held by SDCEP, updated yearly and are available on request. At the beginning of each group meeting during guidance development, participants are asked to confirm whether there are any changes to their Declaration of Interests. </p>
<p>Any declared interests which could constitute a conflict of interest are considered by the group to decide whether and how the extent of the individual's participation in the guidance development should be limited (e.g., exclusion from certain decisions or stages, or complete withdrawal). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary of Disclosures</strong></span></p>
<p>All of the GDG members completed and returned the Declaration of Interests form. The Clinical Co-Chairs of the group had no declared interests. Three of the 18 external group members disclosed interests relevant to the guidance which could potentially cause, or be perceived to cause, conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>For the <em>Oral Health Management of Patients at Risk of Medication-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw</em> guidance project the potential conflicts of interest and management decisions are available in the Guidance Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
