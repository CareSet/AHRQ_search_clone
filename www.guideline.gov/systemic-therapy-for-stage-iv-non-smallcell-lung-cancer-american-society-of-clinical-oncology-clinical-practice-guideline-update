<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question A2. First-Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A2.a. Non&ndash;Squamous Cell Carcinoma (NSCC) and Negative or Unknown <em>EGFR</em> or <em>ALK/ROS1</em>. What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with NSCC and negative or unknown tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>)-sensitizing mutation, aplastic lymphoma kinase (<em>ALK</em>) or proto-oncogene receptor kinase (<em>ROS1</em>) gene rearrangement status, and with performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (or possibly PS of 2)? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A2.a</em>: Treatment options include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" start="1">
    <li>For patients with high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] &ge;50%), single-agent pembrolizumab should be used in the absence of contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to recommend other checkpoint inhibitors or to recommend combination checkpoint inhibitors or immune checkpoint therapy with chemotherapy in the first-line setting at the time of this update. </li>
    <li>For patients with low PD-L1 expression (TPS &lt;50%), clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy with platinum-based two-drug combinations as outlined in the 2015 update (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong) or non&ndash;platinum-based two-drug therapy as outlined in the 2015 update for patients not deemed candidates for platinum-based therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: weak). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with SCC, negative or unknown tumor <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation or <em>ALK</em> or <em>ROS1</em> gene rearrangement status, and PS of 0 or 1 (or possibly PS of 2)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A3</em>: Treatment options include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" start="1">
    <li>For patients with high PD-L1 expression (TPS &ge;50%), single-agent pembrolizumab should be used in the absence of contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to recommend other checkpoint inhibitors or to recommend combination checkpoint inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy in the first-line setting. </li>
    <li>For patients with low (TPS &lt;50%) or unknown PD-L1 expression, clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy with platinum-based, two-drug combinations as outlined in the 2015 update (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong) or non&ndash;platinum-based, two-drug therapy as outlined in the 2015 update for patents not deemed candidates for platinum-based therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: weak). </li>
    <li>For patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC receiving cisplatin and gemcitabine, the Panel neither recommends for nor recommends against the addition of necitumumab to chemotherapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: weak). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question B. Second-Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B1. What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with negative or unknown tumor <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation, <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement status, or <em>ROS1</em> gene rearrangement status and PS of 0 or 1 (or possibly PS of 2)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B1.a. Negative/Unknown <em>EGFR/ALK/ROS1</em>. What is the most effective therapy for patients with non&ndash;squamous cell carcinoma who have received one prior chemotherapy regimen?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B1</em>: Squamous and non-squamous and negative or unknown <em>EGFR</em> mutation, <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement status, or <em>ROS1</em> gene rearrangement status.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" start="1">
    <li>For patients who received first-line chemotherapy and have not received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, clinicians should use single-agent nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab in patients with positive tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS &ge;1%, 22C3 assay) in the absence of contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </li>
    <li>For patients with negative or unknown tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS &lt;1%) who received first line-therapy chemotherapy, clinicians should use single-agent nivolumab or atezolizumab in the absence of contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </li>
    <li>There are insufficient data to recommend combination checkpoint inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy in the second-line setting. </li>
    <li>For patients who received an immune checkpoint inhibitor as first-line therapy, clinicians should offer standard platinum-based chemotherapy, as outlined in the 2015 update (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong), or non&ndash;platinum-based, two-drug therapy if platinum is contraindicated, as outlined in the 2015 update (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong). </li>
    <li>For patients with contraindications to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy after first-line chemotherapy, docetaxel is recommended as second-line therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). </li>
    <li>Non-squamous only: Patients with non&ndash;squamous cell carcinoma who have not previously received pemetrexed-based first-line or maintenance therapy should be offered pemetrexed as second-line therapy (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B3.a. <em>EGFR</em> Positive. What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with a sensitizing <em>EGFR </em>mutation who received a first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and experienced disease progression? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B3.a</em>: For patients with stage IV NSCLC with a sensitizing <em>EGFR </em>mutation and disease progression after first-line therapy with an EGFR-TKI and the presence of the T790M resistance mutation, clinicians should recommend osimertinib (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). If the T790M mutation is not present, clinicians may offer treatment with a platinum doublet (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation B3.b</em>: Patients who received an EGFR-TKI in the first-line setting, had an initial response, and subsequently experienced slow or minimal disease progression at isolated sites may continue EGFR-TKI with local therapy to the isolated sites (Type: informal consensus-based; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B6. <em>ROS1</em> Rearrangement. What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with <em>ROS1 </em>rearrangement?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B6.a. Patients who have not received prior crizotinib</em>: If patients have <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement and have not received crizotinib in the first-line setting, single-agent crizotinib may be offered as second-line therapy (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation B6.b. Patient who received prior crizotinib</em>: If patients have <em>ROS1</em> rearrangement and have received crizotinib in the first-line setting, then they may be offered platinum-based therapy in the second-line setting with or without bevacizumab (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B8. <em>BRAF</em> Mutations. What is the most effective therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC and <em>BRAF</em> mutations who have received prior chemotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B8</em>: Clinicians may offer atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab (if PD-L1 TPS &gt;1%) in patients with <em>BRAF</em> mutations unless the patient received immune checkpoint therapy in the first-line setting (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak). If patients with <em>BRAF</em> mutations received immunotherapy in the second-line, clinicians may offer patients dabrafenib alone or in combination with trametinib in the third-line (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question C. Third-Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question C1. <em>EGFR</em> Negative. What is the most effective third-line therapy for patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC, negative or unknown tumor <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation or <em>ALK</em> or <em>ROS1</em> gene rearrangement status, and PS of 0 or 1 (or possibly PS of 2)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation C1</em>: For the majority of patients who received chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab and immune checkpoint therapy, clinicians should offer the options of single-agent pemetrexed or docetaxel in the third-line setting (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question C2. <em>EGFR</em> Positive. What is the most effective third-line therapy for patients with a tumor <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation C2</em>: There are insufficient data to recommend immunotherapy in preference to chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) for patients with <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutations who have received at least one EGFR-TKI and subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy (Type: informal consensus based; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question D. Fourth-Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question D1. Is there a role for cytotoxic therapy in patients who have received three prior regimens and who have a good PS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation D1</em>: Data are not sufficient to make a recommendation for or against using cytotoxic drugs as fourth-line therapy; patients should consider experimental treatment, clinical trials, and continued best supportive (palliative) care. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question A1. General</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A1. Which patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer should be treated with chemotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A1.a</em>: For patients with performance status of 0 or 1 <em>receiving chemotherapy</em>, a combination of two cytotoxic drugs is recommended. Platinum combinations are recommended over nonplatinum therapy; however, nonplatinum therapy combinations are recommended for patients who have contraindications to platinum therapy. Chemotherapy may also be used to treat selected patients with PS of 2 who desire aggressive treatment after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of such treatment (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation A1.b</em>: Because there is no cure for patients with stage IV NSCLC, early concomitant palliative care assistance has improved the survival and well being of patients and is therefore recommended (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question A2. First Line Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A2. What is the most effective first-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with NSCC, negative or unknown <em>EGFR</em>-sensitizing mutation and <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangement status, and PS 0 to 1 or possibly PS 2?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A2</em>: Treatment options include:</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Question A8. Elderly. What is the best chemotherapy for treatment of the elderly with stage IV NSCLC?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A8</em>: Decisions on the selection of chemotherapy should not be made or altered based on age alone (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question A9. Maintenance. What is the optimal treatment for patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation A9</em>: In patients with stage IV NSCLC, first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy should be stopped at disease progression or after four cycles in patients whose disease is stable but not responding to treatment; two-drug cytotoxic combinations should be administered for no more than six cycles. For patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of a first-line pemetrexed-containing regimen, continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed is recommended. For patients with stable disease or response after four cycles of a regimen that did not include a pemetrexed-containing combination, alternative single-agent chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous histology, docetaxel in unselected patients, or erlotinib in unselected patients, or a break from cytotoxic chemotherapy with initiation of second-line chemotherapy at disease progression may be recommended (Addition of pemetrexed: Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Question B2. What is the most effective therapy for patients with squamous cell carcinoma who have received one prior chemotherapy regimen?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B2</em>: For patients with advanced NSCLC, SCC, negative or unknown <em>EGFR/ALK</em> status, and adequate PS, when disease has progressed during or after first-line platinum-based therapy, docetaxel, erlotinib, or gefitinib is acceptable as second-line therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B4. <em>ALK</em> Rearrangement. What is the most effective second-line therapy for patients with stage IV NSCLC with <em>ALK</em> rearrangement with progression after first-line crizotinib?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B4</em>: Patients whose tumors have <em>ALK</em> rearrangements and who received crizotinib in the first-line setting may be offered the option of chemotherapy (after first-line recommendations for patients with NSCC [see Recommendation A2]) or ceritinib in the second-line setting (Chemotherapy: Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong; Ceritinib: Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question B5. Elderly. What is the optimal second-line treatment for elderly patients with stage IV NSCLC?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation B5</em>: The evidence does not support the selection of a specific second-line chemotherapy drug or combination based on age alone. This recommendation has not changed. As stated in Recommendation A8, age alone is not a contraindication to chemotherapy for NSCLC.</p>

Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this guideline was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Thoracic Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p>The recommendations were developed by an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation using a systematic review (MEDLINE, February 2014 to December 2016) of phase II or III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical experience. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence based on the following criteria:</p>

    <li>Minimal sample size of 20 patients for immune checkpoint therapy or targeted therapy studies (50 patients for chemotherapy) </li>
    <li>Studies must have met enrollment targets </li>
    <li>Used intent-to-treat analysis for primary and secondary outcomes </li>
    <li>Independent determination of response </li>
    <li>For non-RCTs used to support recommendations, results must have been consistent </li>

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewer in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by one staff reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the manuscript and/or in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study design aspects related to individual study quality, strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and risk of bias were assessed (Tables 4 and 5 in the original guideline document). Study quality was formally assessed for 15 (one set combined in assessment) trials identified by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Table 5 in the original guideline document. Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) assessed five studies separately, with slightly different methods (Table 4 in the original guideline document). Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one ASCO reviewer, with factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, and funding sources, generally indicating a low to intermediate potential risk of bias for most of the identified evidence. Refer to the Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents") for definitions of ratings for overall potential risk of bias.</p></div></p>

<p>The Expert Panel met via teleconference and webinar and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. </p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines staff updated the literature search that was conducted to inform its recommendations on the systemic therapy of patients with stage IV NSCLC. MEDLINE was searched from February 2014 to December 2016. The updated search was restricted to articles published in English and to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. The updated search was guided by the signals approach, which is designed to identify only new, potentially practice-changing data&mdash;signals&mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on targeted routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO Expert Panel members to help identify potential signals. The ASCO Expert Panel and guidelines staff will work with the Steering Committee to keep abreast of any substantive updates to the guideline. Based on formal review of the emerging literature, ASCO will determine the need to update.</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations are crafted, in part, using the Guidelines Into Decision Support methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software. Ratings were made to the draft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" fields). In some selected cases where evidence is lacking, but there was a high level of agreement among the Expert Panel, informal consensus is used (as noted with the recommendations).</p>
<p>Detailed information about the methods used to develop this guideline update is available in the Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), including an overview (e.g., panel composition, development process, and revision dates); literature search and data extraction; the recommendation development process (GLIDES and BRIDGE-Wiz); and quality assessment.</p></div></p>

The Panel concurred that patients who have received solid organ transplantations and patients with autoimmune disease that is clinically active or requires corticosteroids should not receive immune checkpoint therapy based on existing literature and the Panel's expert opinion. Reviewing literature on toxicity management for patients receiving immune checkpoint therapy outside of clinical trials was outside the scope of this guideline; however, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are developing guidelines on the management of patients with immune-mediated adverse effects. The Panel wishes to highlight the importance of external generalizability to additional populations of patients with lung cancer not included in the clinical trials as an area of future study. Some contraindications may be relative; benefits of therapy may potentially outweigh harms; thus, clinicians will need to evaluate these patients on a case-by-case basis.</p></div></p>

<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
