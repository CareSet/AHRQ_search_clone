                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence-Based, Formal Consensus, Informal Consensus, No Recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>The following recommendations are evidence based, informed by generally small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and guided by clinical experience. Ratings for benefits, harms, evidence quality, and recommendation strength are provided in Table 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)</strong></p>
<p>There are no established agents recommended for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents. This is based on the paucity of high-quality, consistent evidence and a balance of benefits versus harms.</p>
<p>Clinicians should not offer the following agents for the prevention of CIPN to patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) </li>
    <li>Amifostine </li>
    <li>Amitriptyline </li>
    <li>CaMg for patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Diethyldithio-carbamate (DDTC) </li>
    <li>Glutathione (GSH) for patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Nimodipine </li>
    <li>Org 2766 </li>
    <li>All-<em>trans</em>-retinoic acid </li>
    <li>Recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (RhuLIF) </li>
    <li>Vitamin E </li>
</ul>
<p>Venlafaxine is not recommended for routine use in clinical practice. Although the venlafaxine data resulted in some support for its utility, the data were not strong enough to recommend its use in clinical practice until additional supporting data become available.</p>
<p>No recommendations can be made on the use of <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine, carbamazepine, glutamate, GSH (for patients receiving cisplatin or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy), goshajinkigan (GJG), omega-3 fatty acids, or oxcarbazepine for the prevention of CIPN at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of CIPN</strong></p>
<p>For patients with cancer experiencing CIPN, clinicians may offer duloxetine.</p>
<p>No recommendations can be made on the use of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>ALC, noting that a positive phase III abstract supported its value, but this work has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and a prevention trial suggested that this agent was associated with worse outcomes. </li>
    <li>Tricyclic antidepressants; however, based on the limited options that are available for this prominent clinical problem and the demonstrated efficacy of these drugs for other neuropathic pain conditions, it is reasonable to try a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., nortriptyline or desipramine) in patients suffering from CIPN after a discussion with the patients about the limited scientific evidence for CIPN, potential harms, benefits, cost, and patient preferences. </li>
    <li>Gabapentin, noting that the available data were limited regarding its efficacy for treating CIPN. However, the panel felt that this agent is reasonable to try for selected patients with CIPN pain given (1) that only a single negative randomized trial for this agent was completed, (2) the established efficacy of gabapentin and pregabalin for other forms of neuropathic pain, and (3) the limited CIPN treatment options. Patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence for CIPN, potential harms, benefits, and costs. </li>
    <li>A topical gel treatment containing baclofen (10 mg), amitriptyline HCL (40 mg), and ketamine (20 mg), noting that a single trial supported that this product did decrease CIPN symptoms. Given the available data, the panel felt that this agent is reasonable to try for selected patients with CIPN pain. Patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence for the treatment of CIPN, potential harms, benefits, and costs. </li>

<p>Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 16), and AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine; 1985 to April 2013) databases were searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. Before the systematic search of the medical literature, an environmental scan was conducted for existing reviews regarding the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). With no recent guidelines identified, older reviews with contents related to the clinical questions had their included studies cross-referenced to the guideline panel's literature search. Reference lists from other published seminal papers were scanned for additional citations. The literature search strategy is available in Appendix Table A3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Focused on chemotherapy-induced neuropathy </li>
    <li>Included cancer survivors </li>
    <li>Considered neuropathy as an important outcome of study </li>

<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>A draft of the clinical practice guideline was reviewed by two Clinical Practice Guideline Committee members and 12 Survivorship Guideline Advisory Group members. In addition to providing comment and feedback, practitioners were asked to judge the evidence review and agreement with the recommendations. One additional reviewer was asked to assess the clarity of the recommendations and ease of implementation. The evidence review was rated as high quality, and there was high agreement with the substance of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The compounded topical baclofen-amitriptyline-ketamine gel was identified as having barriers to implementation. The product was created by one compounding pharmacy for a trial, and the combination is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Lack of insurance reimbursement for compounded products was also raised. Although not a recommended treatment, the statement regarding the topical gel as an option comes with a qualifier that specifies patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence, potential harms, benefits, and costs.</p></div></p>

With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.

Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicate that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating clinician to select other courses of action in individual cases.

    <li>A number of nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated for their role in preventing or treating peripheral neuropathy. However, the paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence prohibited inclusion of those studies in this systematic review. Moreover, the studies were often conducted in diabetic populations, with no specific focus on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Nevertheless, several of the interventions have been tested in populations that included patients with cancer experiencing CIPN and, as such, merit further examination. </li>
