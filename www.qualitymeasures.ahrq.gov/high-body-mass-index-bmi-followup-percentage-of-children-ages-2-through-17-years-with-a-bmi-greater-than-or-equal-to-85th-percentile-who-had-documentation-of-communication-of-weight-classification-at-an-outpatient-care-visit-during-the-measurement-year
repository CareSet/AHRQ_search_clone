                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children ages 2 through 17 years with a body mass index&nbsp;(BMI) greater than or equal to 85th percentile who had documentation of communication of weight classification at an outpatient care visit during the measurement year. A higher proportion indicates better performance.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rationale</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Obesity in children is associated with a broad spectrum of serious health issues, including obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, orthopedic problems, and skin conditions (Barlow, 2007). While childhood obesity rates have stabilized over the past decade, the percentage of young children and adolescents who are overweight or obese remains high (Ogden et al., 2014). For the 2011&ndash;2012 period, nearly 32% of children in the United States were reported to be either overweight or obese (having a BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile on sex-specific age-for-growth charts), and 17% were obese (having a BMI greater than or equal to 95th percentile) (Ogden et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Family awareness of excess weight in a child is an essential first step toward making healthy changes that support appropriate weight levels. However, research shows that providers often do not discuss weight issues with parents of overweight/obese patients or they communicate in a way that parents do not recall (Perrin, Skinner, &amp; Steiner, 2012). (Note: The word "parent" is inclusive of many caregivers, including biological parents, legal guardians, or other family members who are primary caregivers.) If health care providers discuss weight with families in a timely, informative, and supportive manner, they can foster the confidence and skills necessary for parents and children to address dietary and physical activity behaviors (Huang et al., 2007). Many issues exist that make these discussions difficult: for clinicians, lack of familiarity with guidelines, too little support and time in the clinic, concerns about stigmatization, and parental misperceptions about normal versus overweight in their own children (Klein et al., 2010; Dietz &amp; Robinson, 2005; Doolen, Alpert, &amp; Miller, 2009). Families are crucial partners in addressing weight issues, and clinicians are in an excellent position to provide appropriate guidance. Improving the frequency and quality of these conversations is an essential first step toward helping children reach and maintain a healthy weight.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><em>Importance</em><br/>
Childhood overweight and obesity are recognized as major medical and public health problems associated with serious medical complications over the life course, including conditions such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension (Speiser et al., 2005). As a result, early screening and identification of weight status in children is critical for both prevention and treatment of childhood overweight and obesity. Primary care providers measure weight and height at yearly visits throughout childhood and can calculate BMI by dividing weight by height squared. Overweight is defined as a BMI percentile of the 85th to 94th percentile, and obesity is defined as a BMI percentile greater than or equal to 95th percentile on sex-specific age-for-growth charts (Barlow, 2007). Guidelines suggest that patients in the overweight category receive counseling about prevention; those who are obese are quite likely to have obesity-related health risks and should be encouraged to work on weight control practices (Barlow, 2007).</p>
<p><em>Prevalence of Obesity and Unhealthy Weight in Children</em><br/>
Significant increases in the prevalence of United States (U.S.) childhood obesity across both sexes were seen in the 1980s and 1990s (Ogden et al., 2012). For the 2011&ndash;2012 period, nearly 32% of children in the United States were reported to be overweight or obese (having a BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile) and at least 17% were obese (having a BMI greater than or equal to 95th percentile) (Ogden et al., 2014). At the population level, this increase in prevalence is too rapid to be a genetic shift. Rather, changes in eating and physical activity behaviors are affecting the intake and expenditure of energy, resulting in overweight and obesity (Barlow, 2007).</p>
<p><em>Cost of Obesity and Unhealthy Weight in Children</em><br/>
Excess weight in young people creates great economic burden. Children who are obese are approximately three times more expensive for the health care system than the average insured child, and children diagnosed with obesity are two to three times more likely to be hospitalized (Marder &amp; Chang, 2006). In a study by Wang et al. (2008), the authors used projected overweight/obesity prevalence and national estimates of per capita excess health care costs of overweight/obesity to estimate that health care costs attributable to overweight/obesity in the entire U.S. population would reach between $861 and $957 billion by 2030, accounting for 16% to 18% of U.S. health care costs.</p>
<p><em>Pathology and Severity of Obesity and Unhealthy Weight in Children</em><br/>
Medical issues associated with obesity affect almost every organ of the body, though some conditions are without symptoms and signs (Barlow, 2007). Obese children are more likely to suffer from respiratory issues such as disordered breathing (Wing et al., 2003), which can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension, as well as inattention, poor academic performance, and enuresis (Barlow, 2007). Asthma also occurs more frequently among children who are obese (Barlow, 2007). Gastrointestinal problems include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is related to both obesity and diabetes (Barlow, 2007); gallstones (Kaechele et al., 2006); and gastroesophageal reflux disease and constipation, which are worsened by obesity (Barlow, 2007). Obese children are more likely to have endocrine disorders such as abnormal glucose metabolism (sometimes called pre-diabetes), which indicates higher risk for the development of diabetes (Li et al., 2009); type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome; and hypothyroidism (Barlow, 2007). Cardiovascular problems for overweight/obese children include dyslipidemia (Lamb et al., 2011) and hypertension (Barlow, 2007). Orthopedic problems include Blount disease (a visible bowing of the lower extremities), slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and an increased risk of fractures, musculoskeletal pain, and orthopedic problems (Dietz, Gross, &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1982; Manoff, Banffy, &amp; Winell, 2005). Skin conditions include acanthosis nigricans, a chronic irritation and infection in the folds of the skin (Nguyen et al., 2001). Metabolic syndrome, a cluster of concurrent conditions (abnormal triglycerides, large waist circumference, and high blood pressure) that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes is not yet defined in children (Speiser et al., 2005). However, among severely obese children, the risk of developing metabolic syndrome has been estimated at 50% (Weiss et al., 2004).</p>
<p>Children who are obese also contend with psychiatric problems, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders (Barlow, 2007). One study found that among female adolescents who were obese, patterns of observation showed more adverse social, educational, and psychological correlates (Falkner et al., 2001). Children who are obese may also be at risk for academic difficulties, alcohol and tobacco use, premature sexual behavior, inappropriate dieting practices, and physical inactivity (Daniels et al., 2009). Increasing weight is associated with decreasing health-related quality of life, lower body satisfaction, and lower self-esteem. Children who are overweight experience more teasing and are vulnerable to bullying (Daniels et al., 2009). Children share society's negative opinions about those who are overweight or obese, regardless of their own weight status or sex (Speiser et al., 2005). Their perceptions of obesity emphasize laziness, selfishness, lower intelligence, social isolation, poor social functioning, as well as low levels of perceived health, healthy eating, and activity. Children as young as 5 years of age are aware of their own levels of overweight, which affects their perceptions of appearance, athletic ability, social competence, and self-worth (Speiser et al., 2005). Research has also shown that children diagnosed with obesity are much more likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorders or bone and joint disorders than children who are not obese; they are also two-to-three times more likely to be hospitalized (Marder &amp; Chang, 2006).</p>
<p>Being overweight or obese in early life also has implications for a child's future health. First, for a child with a BMI above the 85th percentile, medical risks include future or persistent obesity (Barlow, 2007; Daniels et al., 2009). The risk of an obese child becoming an obese adult is 25% at age 6 years, increasing to 75% during adolescence (Baker et al., 2010). Being overweight or obese in childhood and adolescence is also associated with increased risk of premature mortality and comorbidities in adulthood. A 2011 systematic review reports a significant association between child and adolescent overweight/obesity and premature mortality, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.4 to 2.9 (Reilly &amp; Kelly, 2011). In addition, being overweight or obese as a child or adolescent is significantly associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic morbidity (including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke) in later life, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.1 to 5.1, as well as increased risk of asthma in adulthood and polycystic ovary syndrome in adult women (Reilly &amp; Kelly, 2011). Obesity in in adolescence is associated with negative self-image that persists into adulthood (Dietz, 1998). These children are also at long-term higher risk for chronic conditions such as breast, colon, and kidney cancer; musculoskeletal disorders; and gall bladder disease (Daniels et al., 2009). Childhood obesity contributes to a significant and increasing burden of chronic disease, rising health care costs, disability, and premature death.</p>
<p><em>Performance Gap</em><br/>
Despite the clear benefits of counseling families about their child's weight status, many parents are not getting the message. In one study among children with a BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile, only 22% of parents reported being told their child was overweight and only 58% of parents of very obese children recalled being told of their child's weight status (Perrin, Skinner, &amp; Steiner, 2012). Other studies report similarly low numbers. Lazorick et al. (2011) found that documentation of counseling regarding nutrition and physical activity was rare: 16% for children ages 3 to 5 years old and 7% for ages 13 to 16 years old. Many of the overweight adolescents in this study already had comorbidities seen more frequently in adults. A third study reported a somewhat better rate of 51% for frequency of diet, exercise, and weight reduction counseling, but its authors noted the rate was still inadequate and did not address the depth or quality of counseling (Patel et al., 2010). Yet another study found that among overweight children, aged 2 to 19 years old, (or their parents), only 37% reported having ever been told by a provider that they were overweight (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). Among those ages 2 to 5 years old, the rate was 17%, and from there it rose steadily: 33% for children ages 6 to 11 years old; 40% for ages 12 to 15 years old; and 52% for the oldest group, ages 16 to 19 years old.</p>
<p>Low rates of discussion are prevalent, but unacceptable. Children and families need help in addressing unhealthy weight. By the time children are of school age, they are already responding to environmental cues, not satiety, in deciding what they want to eat (Rolls, Engell, &amp; Birch, 2000). By the age of 5 years, the amount of food offered influences how much a child eats; in younger children (age 3&frac12; years), the amount of food presented did not affect the amount consumed. As children develop, food intake is affected by social, cultural, and environmental factors (Rolls, Engell, &amp; Birch, 2000). Early recognition of this developmental change is important to helping children learn good habits.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#">Extent of Measure Testing</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br/>
<em>Data and Methods</em>. Testing data were obtained through an audit of medical records maintained by HealthCore, Inc. HealthCore is an independent subsidiary of Anthem, Inc., the largest health benefits company/insurer in the United States. HealthCore owns and operates the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD), a longitudinal database of medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment information for members from 14 geographically diverse Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Health Plans in the Northeast, South, West, and Central regions of the United States with members living in all 50 states. In total, the HIRD includes approximately 59 million individuals between January 2006 and June 2014.</p>
<p>More than 12 million members were enrolled at some point during the 2013 measurement year for this study, among which 2.3 million were aged 2 to 18 years old. There were 637,100 children aged 2 to 18 years with a routine outpatient encounter in 2013 who were currently enrolled and were fully insured. This group was narrowed to a subset who had a provider with a specialty of pediatric medicine or general practice/family practice (451,003). One child per family was then randomly selected, resulting in 293,741 eligible children from all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>A simple random sample (SRS) was used to select 27,000 candidates for a parent survey of which 26,569 (98%) had valid contact information. From this group, a total of 1,580 parent surveys were completed, of which 402 parents reported that their eligible child had a BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile. Additionally, an independent SRS of 750 candidates was selected to provide additional cases for medical record abstraction to ensure the study goal for abstracted charts would be achieved; 722 children from this group had valid contact information. Combining these two groups, medical records were requested for review for 1,124 (402+722) children. In total, 600 medical records were reviewed and abstracted.</p>
<p>Once subjects were identified, patient medical records were requested from provider offices and health care facilities; these records were sent to a centralized location for data abstraction. Trained nurse or pharmacist medical record abstractors collected and entered information from paper copies of the medical records into a password-protected database. To help ensure consistency of data collection, the medical record abstractors were trained on the study's design and presented with a standardized data collection form designed to minimize the need to make subjective judgments during the abstraction process. In addition, data entered onto a scanner form and subsequently scanned was reviewed through a series of quality checks.</p>
<p>Reliability of medical record data was determined through re-abstraction of patient record data to calculate the inter-rater reliability (IRR). Broadly, IRR is the extent to which the abstracted information is collected in a consistent manner. Low IRR may be a sign of poorly executed abstraction procedures, such as ambiguous wording in the data collection tool, inadequate abstractor training, or abstractor fatigue. For this measure, the medical record data collected by two abstractors was individually compared with the data obtained by a senior abstractor to gauge the IRR for each abstractor. Any differences were remedied by review of the chart. IRR was determined by calculating both percent agreement and Cohen's Kappa statistic.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>. Data were abstracted from 600 medical records; 216 children (36.0%) met denominator criteria as being between 2 through 17 years and having a calculated BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile, based on height and weight from the medical record. Of these, 20 records (9.3%) from the two abstractors were reviewed for IRR. Agreement was assessed for three measure variables: documentation of communication of weight status, documentation of height, and documentation of weight (necessary to calculate BMI). </p>
<p>Table 3 in the original measure documentation shows the percent agreement and Kappa statistic for each variable. Abstractor agreement for documentation of communication regarding weight status was 90%, with a Kappa statistic of 0.899. Agreement for documentation of height and documentation of weight were both 100%, with Kappa statistics of 1. These results indicate a very high level of IRR was achieved for all measure variables.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br/>
<em>Face Validity</em>. Face validity is the degree to which the measure construct characterizes the concept being assessed. The face validity of this measure was established by a national panel of experts and advocates for families of children with high BMI convened by the Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC). The Q-METRIC expert panel included nationally recognized experts in childhood obesity, representing pediatrics, nephrology, nutrition and dietetics, endocrinology, gastroenterology, health behavior/education, and family advocacy. In addition, measure validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC High BMI Follow-Up panel included 17 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on childhood obesity and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans.</p>
<p>The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to effective management and treatment of childhood obesity. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. This measure was very highly rated, receiving an average score of 7.9 (with 9 as the highest possible score).</p>
<p><em>Abstracted Medical Record Data</em>. This measure was tested using medical record data. This source is considered the gold standard for clinical information; our findings indicate that these data have a high degree of face validity and reliability. In total, 600 charts were reviewed.</p>
<p>The eligible population for the denominator is the number of children, ages 2 through 17 years old, with a BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile, who had an outpatient care visit during the measurement year (January 1&ndash;December 31). This measure was tested using two methods for determining the denominator:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Calculated BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile; based on BMI calculated from height and weight recorded in the medical record. </li>
    <li>Recorded BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile; based on a BMI percentile recorded in the medical record. </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Calculated BMI</span>. A total of 216 children (36.0%) met denominator criteria as being between 2 through 17 years old and having a calculated BMI greater than or equal to 85th percentile, based on height and weight from the medical record. Among these children, 4.6% (n=10) had documentation of communication of weight classification at an outpatient care visit during the measurement year (refer to Table 4 in the original measure documentation).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recorded BMI</span>. Overall, 91 children (15.2%) met denominator criteria for being between 2 through 17 years old and having a recorded BMI (based on a BMI percentile recorded by the provider) greater than or equal to 85th percentile. Among these children, 7 children (7.7%) had documentation of communication of weight classification at an outpatient care visit during the measurement year (refer to Table 4 in the original measure documentation).</p></div></p>
