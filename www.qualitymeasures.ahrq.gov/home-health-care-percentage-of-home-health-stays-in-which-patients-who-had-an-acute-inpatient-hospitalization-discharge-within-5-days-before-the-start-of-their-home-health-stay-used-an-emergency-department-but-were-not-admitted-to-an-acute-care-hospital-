                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of home health stays in which patients who had an acute inpatient hospitalization discharge within 5 days before the start of their home health stay used an emergency department but were not admitted to an acute care hospital during the 30 days following the start of the home health stay.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rationale</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The emergency department (ED) serves an important function in post-acute care that has not been recognized with reports that one third of hospital revisits are missed if ED visits are not included (Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009). ED visits have been described as gateway encounters for hospital re-admissions. A recent study highlighted the importance of measuring both ED visits and inpatient readmissions after a hospital discharge (Rising et al., 2013). In this study from a single hospital, measures which evaluate readmission to the inpatient setting and do not include a return to the ED would miss 54 percent of all ED use after an inpatient stay. Thus, measuring ED use as well as inpatient readmission can help identify potential areas to improve care.</p>
<p>Rates of ED use without hospital readmission remain substantial with 9.1 percent of home health patients experiencing ED use without readmission in the first 30 days of care. Currently, home health care agencies focus on measures of acute care hospitalization and ED use without hospitalization (applied to all home health patients) as a measure of their effectiveness. This new measure will allow home health agencies to further target patients who entered home health after a hospitalization. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided support to the Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) to address the high rates of readmission. There are other national initiatives to address hospital readmissions including work by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, the National Priority Partnership and others. As described in the Evidence Submission Form, there are interventions that may be effective in reducing ED use without readmission including care transition models and telehealth. Thus, continued reporting is beneficial as this is one outcome that is a national priority across sites of care and for which there is evidence of how to impact the measure.</p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>As a measure of internal consistency, the measure developer conducted a split-half reliability test using 100 percent of each home health agency's patients. Stays for each home health agency were randomly divided into two 50 percent samples, and simulations were run on each 50 percent sample to group the agency into either the "better than expected," "same as expected," or "worse than expected" category. Finally, the results between the two samples for each home health agency were compared to assess how consistently the home health agency was grouped into either the "better than expected," "same as expected," or "worse than expected" category. The measure developer restricted this analysis to home health agencies with at least 40 valid stays, so that each 50 percent sample had at least 20 stays (which is the minimum number of stays required to protect patient confidentiality in public reporting).</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>For the split-half test, using each home health agency's 50 percent samples to produce two simulations and groupings, the majority of the home health agencies were grouped into the same performance category. Refer to the figure in the original measure documentation, which depicts the results of the split-half test; as represented by the numbers and percentages along the diagonal (i.e., upper-left to bottom-right), 3,855 agencies (78 percent) were grouped into the same performance category as a result of the split-half test. Four-hundred and sixty (10 percent) agencies shifted between the "better than expected" and "same as expected" categories, and 628 agencies (12 percent) shifted between the "worse than expected" and "same as expected" categories. Only 10 agencies shifted between the "better than expected" and "worse than expected" categories.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Critical Data Elements &ndash; Method</span>. Review of 2010 Medicare Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) Report. </p>
<p>As the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) audits a sample of claims for services provided under Medicare Part B, including emergency department use, as part of annual payment error calculations, additional validity testing of measure elements has not been conducted. The annual payment error calculation for 2010 involved a sample of Medicare claims that were then compared to medical records and included 31,766 claims for services provided under Medicare Part B. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Empirical Validity Testing &ndash; Method</span>. The measure developer assessed the convergent validity of the measure, which refers to the extent to which measures that are designed to assess the same construct are related to each other. To evaluate the convergent validity of the measure, the measure developer compared the mean performance rates of home health agencies in the "better than expected" category on four measures of home health quality derived from Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) assessments, compared to agencies who were not identified as "better than average" (i.e., home health agencies in the "same as expected" plus "worse than expected" categories).</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Critical Data Elements &ndash; Results</span>. For Part B claims reviewed, 12.9 percent had some type of payment error. Payment errors include no documentation, insufficient documentation, medically unnecessary service, incorrect coding, and other. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Empirical Validity Testing &ndash; Results</span>. Refer to the table in the original measure documentation, which compares the mean performance rates between home health agencies in the "better than expected" category and other home health agencies (i.e., home health agencies in the "same as expected" plus "worse than expected" categories) on four measures of home health quality derived from OASIS assessments.</p>
<p>Refer to the original measure documentation for additional measure testing information. </p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The measure developer used a multinomial logistic model to account for beneficiary factors that may affect rates of hospitalization but are outside of the home health agency's control. Because these measures evaluate two different but related outcomes, one multinomial logistic framework models the three disjoint outcomes: no acute care use (no event), emergency department use without hospital readmission, and rehospitalization. A multinomial logistic model allows for the same risk factors to affect the possible outcomes in different ways while also constraining predicted probabilities of all three events to sum to one hundred percent. The risk adjustment model uses six months of claims prior to the start of home health care to obtain information about the beneficiary. The measure developer identified a set of 404 covariates that consisted of statistically significant predictors of acute care rehospitalization or emergency use without hospital readmission. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published the risk adjustment model specifications on the Home Health Quality Initiative page in December 2013. The five beneficiary-level risk factors included in the multinomial logistic regression model are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Prior care setting </li>
    <li>Age and sex interactions </li>
    <li>Health status </li>
    <li>Medicare enrollment status </li>
    <li>Additional interaction terms </li>
