                        <h3><a href="#">Description</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) for patients discharged from the hospital after admission for any eligible condition. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions.</p>
<p>The measure reports a single summary RSRR, derived from the volume-weighted hospital-level standardized risk ratios (SRRs) for the five specialty cohorts based on groups of related discharge condition categories or procedure categories: surgery/gynecology, general medicine, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rationale</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Readmission following hospitalization is a costly and often preventable event. While it is helpful to assess readmission rates for specific groups of patients, these conditions account for only a small proportion of total readmissions. By contrast, a hospital-wide, all-condition readmission measure could provide a broader assessment of the quality of care at hospitals. Therefore, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has contracted with Yale New Haven Health Services Corporation/Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (YNHHSC/CORE) to develop a claims-based, risk-adjusted hospital-wide readmission (HWR) measure for public reporting that reflects the quality of care for hospitalized patients in the United States.</p>
<p>Hospital readmission, for any reason, is disruptive to patients and caregivers, costly to the healthcare system, and puts patients at additional risk of hospital-acquired infections and complications. Readmissions are also a major source of patient and family stress and may contribute substantially to loss of functional ability, particularly in older patients.</p>
<p>Some readmissions are unavoidable and result from inevitable progression of disease or worsening of chronic conditions. However, readmissions may also result from poor quality of care or inadequate transitional care. Transitional care includes effective discharge planning, transfer of information at the time of discharge, patient assessment and education, and coordination of care and monitoring in the post-discharge period.</p>
<p>Given that studies have shown readmissions within 30 days to be related to quality of care, that interventions have been able to reduce 30-day readmission rates for a variety of specific conditions, and that high and variable readmission rates indicate opportunity for improvement, it is reasonable to consider an all-condition 30-day readmission rate as a quality measure.</p></div></p>

<p>Admissions are assigned to one of five mutually exclusive specialty cohort groups consisting of related conditions or procedures. For each specialty cohort group, the standardized readmission ratio (SRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital.

                        <h3><a href="#">Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure</a></h3>
                    <p><ul><li>A systematic review of the clinical research literature (e.g., Cochrane Review)</li><li>One or more research studies published in a National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexed, peer-reviewed journal</li></ul></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>Many care processes can influence readmission risk. In general, randomized controlled trials have shown that improvement in the following areas can directly reduce readmission rates: quality of care during the initial admission; improvement in communication with patients, their caregivers, and their clinicians; patient education; predischarge assessment; and coordination of care after discharge. Evidence that hospitals have been able to reduce readmission rates through these quality-of-care initiatives illustrates the degree to which hospital practices can affect readmission rates. Successful randomized trials have reduced 30-day readmission rates by 20% to 40% (Jack et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2004; Courtney et al., 2009; Garasen, Windspoll, &amp; Johnsen, 2007; Koehler et al., 2009; Mistiaen, Francke, &amp; Poot, 2007; Naylor et al., 1994; Naylor et al., 1999; van Walraven et al., 2002; Weiss, Yakusheva, &amp; Bobay, 2010; Krumholz et al., 2002). Since 2008, 14 Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations have been funded to focus on care transitions, applying lessons learned from clinical trials. Several have been notably successful in reducing readmissions. The strongest evidence supporting the efficacy of improved discharge processes and enhanced care at transitions is a randomized controlled trial by the Project RED (Re-Engineered Discharge) intervention, in which a nurse was assigned to each patient as a discharge advocate, responsible for patient education, follow-up, medication reconciliation, and preparing individualized discharge instructions sent to the patient's primary care provider and there was a follow-up phone call from a pharmacist within 4 days of discharge demonstrated a 30% reduction in 30-day readmissions (Jack et al., 2009). Hospital processes that reflect the quality of inpatient and outpatient care such as discharge planning, medication reconciliation, and coordination of outpatient care have been shown to reduce readmission rates (Nelson, Maruish, &amp; Axler, 2000). Although readmission rates are also influenced by hospital system characteristics, such as the bed capacity of the local health care system, these hospital characteristics should not influence quality of care (Fisher et al., 1994). Therefore, this measure does not risk adjust for such hospital characteristics. </p>
<p>Studies have estimated the rate of preventable readmissions to be as low as 12% and as high as 76% (Benbassat &amp; Taragin, 2000; Medicare Payment Advisory Commission [MedPAC], 2000). Given that studies have shown readmissions to be related to quality of care, and that interventions have been able to reduce 30-day readmission rates, it is reasonable to consider an all-condition readmission rate as a quality measure.</p>
<p>The hospital-wide risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) measure is thus intended to inform quality-of-care improvement efforts, as individual process-based performance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes. As a result, many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that allow patients and providers to assess relative outcomes performance for hospitals. </p></div></p>

<p>The hospital-wide readmission (HWR) measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models, using the July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They examined the differences in the frequencies of patient risk factors and the model variable coefficients by specialty cohort.</p>
<p>For each of the specialty cohorts, CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for the July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 in the original measure documentation.</p>

This measure assesses unplanned readmissions, from any cause, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an index admission.</p>
<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measure assesses a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>Admissions are assigned to one of five mutually exclusive specialty cohort groups consisting of related conditions or procedures. For each specialty cohort group, the standardized readmission ratio (SRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case mix and service mix.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.</p>
<p class="Note">See the <em><a href="/web/20180625154053/https://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51100&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.qualitynet.org%2fdcs%2fContentServer%3fc%3dPage%26pagename%3dQnetPublic%252FPage%252FQnetTier4%26cid%3d1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 All-cause Hospital-wide Measure Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measure</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180625154053im_/https://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/></em> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br/>
Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identified admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href="/web/20180625154053/https://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/Home/Disclaimer?id=51100&amp;contentType=summary&amp;redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.qualitynet.org%2fdcs%2fContentServer%3fc%3dPage%26pagename%3dQnetPublic%252FPage%252FQnetTier4%26cid%3d1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 All-cause Hospital-wide Measure Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measure</a>&nbsp;<img alt="External Web Site Policy" src="/web/20180625154053im_/https://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/UI/images/icon_externallink.gif"/></em>. </p></div></p>

                    <p><div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (that is, age and comorbid diseases) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. Case mix differences among hospitals are based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>In order to account for differences in service mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for the principal discharge diagnosis of the index admission (grouped into Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] clinical classification software [CCS] diagnosis categories). Thus, for the cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, neurology, and medicine specialty cohorts, the AHRQ CCS diagnosis categories used for risk adjustment are the same as those used to define each of these cohorts (refer to Table D.4, Table D.5, Table D.6, and Table D.7 in the original measure documentation). For the surgery/gynecology cohort, which is defined by AHRQ CCS procedure categories, the AHRQ CCS diagnosis category used for risk adjustment is simply the AHRQ CCS diagnosis category that the principal discharge diagnosis for that surgical admission falls into.</p>
<p>For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for age and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the NQF's endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rate is higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower AHRQ SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the model are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables common to all specialty cohorts and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur during the index admission.</p></div></p>

The measure reports a single summary risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR), derived from the volume-weighted results of five different models, one for each of the following specialty cohorts based on groups of discharge condition categories or procedure categories: surgery/gynecology, general medicine, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology, each of which will be described in greater detail below. The measure also indicates the hospital-level standardized risk ratios (SRR) for each of these five specialty cohorts. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. Admissions for planned procedures that are not accompanied by an acute diagnosis do not count as readmissions in the measure outcome. The target population is patients 18 and over. CMS annually reports the measure for patients who are 65 years or older and are enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare and hospitalized in non-federal hospitals.</a></p>
