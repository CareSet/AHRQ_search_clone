                        <h3><a href="#">Description</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children in the eligible population who turned age 1, 2 or 3 years who had concerning results from a standardized screening test that assessed risk for developmental, behavioral and social delays and who had a referral for follow-up services documented in the medical record by their first, second, or third birthday, respectively. This includes providers beyond early intervention (EI).</p></div></p>
                        <h3><a href="#">Rationale</a></h3>
                    <p><div class="content_para"><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) defines a developmental delay as a "condition in which a child is not developing and/or achieving skills according to the expected time frame." A child that is developmentally challenged may face many barriers throughout life; these barriers are even more severe if a delay in development is not detected early. Delayed or disordered development can lead to further health and behavior problems, including failure in school and social and emotional problems (Council on Children With Disabilities et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Early identification of developmental disabilities through surveillance and screening can lead to timely evaluation, diagnosis and appropriate treatment, including developmental intervention. Developmental surveillance should be a component of every preventive care visit. Standardized developmental screening tools should be used when such surveillance identifies concerns about a child's development. Furthermore, it is recommended that standardized screening for developmental, behavioral and social delays occur at the 9-, 18-, and 24-month OR 30-month well visits.</p>
<p>Pediatricians are not usually successful in identifying children with developmental delays without use of a standardized tool. (Hix-Small et al., 2007). These measures will encourage the use of standardized tools for developmental screening, as delineated by guidelines. Children who are identified earlier are more likely to have developmental promotion activities that can further improve the likelihood that they will be able to start school ready to learn.</p>
<p>This measure is focused on accessing the Bright Futures recommendations related to developmental screening using a standardized tool and the related follow-up and care coordination steps articulated in the AAP statement on developmental screening to which the Bright Futures recommendations are based. This measure builds off the work and recommendations of the Assuring Better Child Health and Development (ABCD) effort related to screening, follow-up and care coordination.</p></div></p>

                    <p><ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Approximately 12% to 18% of United States (U.S.) children may have a developmental and behavioral problem. However, only about two percent of children from birth to two years old receive the necessary early intervention services (Hix-Small et al., 2007). A child who is identified as having a delay in development by the time he starts school and participates in early intervention programs is more likely to graduate high school, hold a job, live independently, and avoid teen pregnancy, delinquency and violent crimes&mdash;representing a saved cost to society of between $30,000 and $100,000 per child (Glascoe &amp; Shapiro, 2007). Studies have shown that developmental surveillance based on non-standardized clinical judgment and observation alone does not accurately identify children with delays. Therefore, national recommendations call for routine, standardized screening of children three times in the first three years (at the 9-, 18- and 24- or 30-month well-visit). </li>
    <li>Findings from the National Survey of Children's Health show that only 19.5% of children are screened in the first five years of life. Despite the evidence, the use of standardized developmental screening tools is uncommon; only about 20% of physicians routinely use developmental screening tests (The Commonwealth Fund, 2008). One study found that pediatricians failed to identify and refer 60% to 80% of children with developmental delays in a timely manner. Another study found that 68% of children with delays were not detected by pediatricians. Though many significant delays occur before school age, less than 50% of children with delays are identified before starting school&mdash;leading to missed opportunities for treatment (Hix-Small et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Studies suggest income disparities exist for developmental screening. One study found that only 23% of low-income children receive recommended preventive and developmental services (Bethell et al., 2002). The Early Intervention Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit for Medicaid children includes screening at each visit; however, as of 2007, 28 states were engaged in lawsuits due to a failure to properly deliver this service (Glascoe &amp; Shapiro, 2007). Another study found that children most at risk for school difficulty were those whose mothers had less than a high school education, those who came from single-mother families, those who had received public assistance, and those who lived in families in which the primary language was not English (High, 2008). Specifically related to screening, the National Survey of Children's Health found that while improvements were needed in increasing screening for all children, significant variations existed in the rates of screening by race-ethnicity and insurance status. </li>
    <li>Studies also suggest that the use of a validated developmental screening questionnaire is more cost-effective method to identify developmental delay when compared to yearly professional assessments. </li>
    <li>Both research and demonstrated quality improvement activities such as the Assuring Better Child Health and Development (ABCD) Screening Academy have shown that providers can feasibly and sustainably implement standardized screening, and when done so, more children are referred to Early Intervention and other services and that the kinds and types of referrals performed are more appropriate than was previously done without standardized screening. </li>
    <li>A recent American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Periodic Survey of Fellows found that the percentage of pediatricians who reported using more than one standardized tool more than doubled between 2002 and 2009, demonstrating significant improvement after changes in AAP policy, enhanced guidance on reimbursement, and increased emphasis on developmental screening through research and educational programs as well as the new Bright Futures guidelines. However, approximately half of the pediatricians reported that they did not routinely use the recommended formal screening tools with patients younger than 36 months of age. Many pediatricians continue to rely on informal checklists completed by the pediatrician, office staff, and/or parents. </li>
    <li>When a child has a positive screening result for a developmental problem, developmental and medical evaluations to identify the specific developmental disorders and related medical problems are warranted. Children diagnosed with developmental disorders should be identified as children with special health care needs; chronic-condition management for these children should be initiated. </li>
    <li>It is important to note that is measure does not included standardized screening for a specific domain of development (e.g., social emotional screening via the ASQ-SE, autism screening) as it is anchored to recommendations focused on global developmental screening using tools that focus on identifying risk for developmental, behavioral and social delays. National recommendations also call for autism screening at the 18-month and 24-month well-visit and future, separate measures may specified and build off the data collection efforts used for this measure to capture domain-specific screening. Additionally, many of the ABCD states included a distinct focus on complementary, but separate, screening specifically focused on social-emotional development (using tools such as the ASQ-SE). Similarly, future efforts may maximize the data collection efforts for this measure to include additional specifications focused specifically on social-emotional screening so that a separate measure may be calculated. </li>
